27037803|t|A case of cervical esophageal duplication cyst in a newborn infant.
27037803|a|Esophageal duplication cyst is a rare congenital anomaly resulting from a foregut budding error during the fourth to sixth week of embryonic development. Cervical esophageal duplication cysts are very rare and may cause respiratory distress in infancy. A full-term newborn girl who was born by normal delivery was transferred to our hospital because of swelling of the right anterior neck since birth. Cervical ultrasonography showed a 40   *   24   *   33  mm simple cyst on the right neck. Tracheal intubation was required at 2  weeks of age because of worsening external compression of the trachea. Fine-needle aspiration cytology revealed the existence of ciliated epithelium. At 1  month of age, exploration was performed through a transverse neck incision. The cyst had a layer of muscle connected to the lateral wall of the esophagus. Histopathological diagnosis was a cervical esophageal duplication cyst. We describe the clinical features of infantile cervical esophageal duplication cysts based on our experience of this rare disease in a neonate, along with a review of 19 cases previously reported in literature.

27083247|t|Polytetrafluoroethylene Bicuspid Pulmonary Valve Replacement: A 5-Year Experience in 119 Patients With Congenital Heart Disease.
27083247|a|BACKGROUND: Durability of bioprosthetic valves in the pulmonary position is suboptimal. The objective of this study was to evaluate midterm outcomes of hand-sewn polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) bicuspid pulmonary valve replacement. METHODS: A retrospective review of 119 patients who underwent bicuspid pulmonary valve replacement using 0.1-mm PTFE membrane between June 2009 and May 2014 was performed. Reintervention was defined as any surgical or percutaneous catheter procedure on the PTFE pulmonary valve. Structural valve deterioration (SVD) was defined as development of a peak pressure gradient equal to or greater than 50 mm Hg or at least a moderate amount of pulmonary regurgitation on follow-up echocardiography. RESULTS: The median age at pulmonary valve replacement was 16.9 years (range 5 months to 57.1 years). Fundamental diagnoses were tetralogy of Fallot (n  = 71), pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (n  = 21), double-outlet right ventricle (n  = 13), and others (n  =  14). The median valve size was 26 mm (range 12 to 30 mm). Two hospital deaths (1.7%) occurred, from ventricular dysfunction and infective endocarditis. At discharge, no patient showed significant pulmonary regurgitation or stenosis. Follow-up completeness was 94.0%, and the median duration of follow-up was 2.6 years (range 0.1 to 5.2 years). One late death occurred, the result of infective endocarditis involving the PTFE pulmonary valve. Actuarial survival was 97.1%    1.6% at 5 years. One patient underwent excision of the PTFE pulmonary valve because of infective endocarditis. Freedom from pulmonary valve reoperation was 99.1%    0.9% at 5 years. Ten patients developed SVD during follow-up, and 6 of them underwent an interventional catheter procedure. Freedom from pulmonary valve reintervention and SVD at 5 years was 90.7%    3.4% and 86.5%    4.0%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Midterm outcomes of hand-sewn PTFE bicuspid pulmonary valve replacement were acceptable. Long-term follow-up of this cohort is mandatory to determine the durability of this valve.

27067309|t|DNA Methylation Profiling Reveals Correlation of Differential Methylation Patterns with Gene Expression in Human Epilepsy.
27067309|a|UNASSIGNED: DNA methylation plays important roles in regulating gene expression and has been reported to be related with epilepsy. This study aimed to define differential DNA methylation patterns in drug-refractory epilepsy patients and to investigate the role of DNA methylation in human epilepsy. We performed DNA methylation profiling in brain tissues from epileptic and control patients via methylated-cytosine DNA immunoprecipitation microarray chip. Differentially methylated loci were validated by bisulfite sequencing PCR, and the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of candidate genes were evaluated by reverse transcriptase PCR. We found 224 genes that showed differential DNA methylation between epileptic patients and controls. Among the seven candidate genes, three genes (TUBB2B, ATPGD1, and HTR6) showed relative transcriptional regulation by DNA methylation. TUBB2B and ATPGD1 exhibited hypermethylation and decreased mRNA levels, whereas HTR6 displayed hypomethylation and increased mRNA levels in the epileptic samples. Our findings suggest that certain genes become differentially regulated by DNA methylation in human epilepsy.

27062253|t|The role of neurogenesis during development and in the adult brain.
27062253|a|UNASSIGNED: Neural stem cells (NSCs) give rise to neurons during development. NSCs persist and neurogenesis continues in restricted regions of postnatal and adult brains. Adult-born neurons integrate into existing neural circuits by synaptic connections and participate in the regulation of brain function. Thus, understanding NSCs and neurogenesis may be crucial in the development of new strategies for brain repair. Here, we introduce the lineage of NSCs from embryonic to adult stages and summarize recent studies on maturation and integration of adult-born neurons. We also discuss the regulation and potential functions of adult neurogenesis in physiological and pathological conditions. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

27003418|t|D-Serine and Glycine Differentially Control Neurotransmission during Visual Cortex Critical Period.
27003418|a|N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) play a central role in synaptic plasticity. Their activation requires the binding of both glutamate and d-serine or glycine as co-agonist. The prevalence of either co-agonist on NMDA-receptor function differs between brain regions and remains undetermined in the visual cortex (VC) at the critical period of postnatal development. Here, we therefore investigated the regulatory role that d-serine and/or glycine may exert on NMDARs function and on synaptic plasticity in the rat VC layer 5 pyramidal neurons of young rats. Using selective enzymatic depletion of d-serine or glycine, we demonstrate that d-serine and not glycine is the endogenous co-agonist of synaptic NMDARs required for the induction and expression of Long Term Potentiation (LTP) at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Glycine on the other hand is not involved in synaptic efficacy per se but regulates excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission by activating strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors, then producing a shunting inhibition that controls neuronal gain and results in a depression of synaptic inputs at the somatic level after dendritic integration. In conclusion, we describe for the first time that in the VC both D-serine and glycine differentially regulate somatic depolarization through the activation of distinct synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors.

27005690|t|Consensus-based training and assessment model for general surgery.
27005690|a|BACKGROUND: Surgical education is becoming competency-based with the implementation of in-training milestones. Training guidelines should reflect these changes and determine the specific procedures for such milestone assessments. This study aimed to develop a consensus view regarding operative procedures and tasks considered appropriate for junior and senior trainees, and the procedures that can be used as technical milestone assessments for trainee progression in general surgery. METHODS: A Delphi process was followed where questionnaires were distributed to all 17 Canadian general surgery programme directors. Items were ranked on a 5-point Likert scale, with consensus defined as Cronbach's a of at least 0  70. Items rated 4 or above on the 5-point Likert scale by 80 per cent of the programme directors were included in the models. RESULTS: Two Delphi rounds were completed, with 14 programme directors taking part in round one and 11 in round two. The overall consensus was high (Cronbach's a   =   0  98). The training model included 101 unique procedures and tasks, 24 specific to junior trainees, 68 specific to senior trainees, and nine appropriate to all. The assessment model included four procedures. CONCLUSION: A system of operative procedures and tasks for junior- and senior-level trainees has been developed along with an assessment model for trainee progression. These can be used as milestones in competency-based assessments.

27095971|t|Molecular Analysis of Sarcocystis Spp. Isolated from Sheep (Ovis aries) in Babol Area, Mazandaran Province, Northern Iran.
27095971|a|BACKGROUND: To differentiate Sarcocystis macro-cyst-forming species in slaughtered sheep in Babol area, Mazandaran Province, sequence analysis of 18S rRNA gene was performed. METHODS: Overall, 150 slaughtered sheep were examined macroscopically in slaughterhouse, Babol and intra-abdominal and diaphragm muscles tissues infected with macro-cyst of Sarcocystis spp. were collected in 2013. One macro-cyst was isolated from the infected muscles of each sheep. The partial 18S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR and sequenced afterward. RESULTS: The rate of infection with macro-cyst producing Sarcocystis spp. was 33.3% (50 / 150). The partial 18S rRNA gene of Sarcocystis species was amplified at the expected PCR product size (   1100 bp) from all 50 macroscopic cysts samples. From 30 sequences DNA samples, 20 samples (66.7%), six (20%) and four (13.3%) isolates were identified as S. gigantea, S. moulei and Sarcocystis spp., respectively. Eight and thirty-four variations in nucleotide position were seen in partial sequence of the18S rRNA gene of S. gigantea and S. moulei. CONCLUSION: Sheep can be considered as an alternative intermediate host for S. moulei. Furthermore, multiple alignments showed some variations in the consensus sequences of the isolates obtained in the current study compared with previously published isolates. To understand better the genetic diversity among Sarcocystis species complete sequences of the18S rRNA gene or sequence analysis of other genetic loci would be beneficial.

27019979|t|Flavonoids induce the expression of acetylcholinesterase in cultured osteoblasts.
27019979|a|UNASSIGNED: Flavonoids, a group of natural compounds mainly derived from plants, are known to possess osteogenic effects in bone cells. Here, we aimed to test if flavonoid could induce a cholinergic enzyme, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), as well as bone differentiation. In cultured rat osteoblasts, twenty flavonoids, deriving from Chinese herbs and having known induction of alkaline phosphatase (ALP(1)) expression, were tested for its induction activity on AChE expression. Eleven flavonoids showed the induction, and five of them had robust activation of AChE expression, including baicalin, calycosin, genistin, hyperin and pratensein: the induction of AChE included the levels of mRNA, protein and enzymatic activity. Moreover, the flavonoid-induced AChE expression in cultured osteoblast was in proline-rich membrane anchor (PRiMA)-linked tetrameric globular form (G4) only. In parallel, the expression of PRiMA was also induced by the application of flavonoids. The flavonoid-induced AChE in the cultures was not affected by estrogen receptor blocker, ICI 182,780. Taken together, the induction of PRiMA-linked AChE in osteoblast should be independent to classical estrogen signaling pathway.

27020244|t|Cpe1786/IscR of Clostridium perfringens represses expression of genes involved in Fe-S cluster biogenesis.
27020244|a|UNASSIGNED: Cpe1786 of Clostridium perfringens is an Rrf2-type regulator containing the three-cysteine residues coordinating a Fe-S in IscR, the repressor controlling Fe-S homeostasis in enterobacteria. The cpe1786 gene formed an operon with iscSU involved in Fe-S biogenesis and tmrU. This operon was transcribed from a   (A)-dependent promoter. We showed that in the heterologous host Bacillus subtilis, Cpe1786, renamed IscRCp, negatively controlled its own transcription. We constructed an iscR mutant in C. perfringens. We then compared the expression profile of strain 13 and of the iscR mutant. IscRCp controlled expression of genes involved in Fe-S biogenesis, in amino acid or sugar metabolisms, in fermentation pathways and in host compound utilization. We then demonstrated, using a ChIP-PCR experiment, that IscRCp interacted with its promoter region in  vivo in C. perfringens and with the promoter of cpe2093 encoding an amino acid ABC transporter. We utilized a comparative genomic approach to infer a candidate IscR binding motif and reconstruct IscR regulons in clostridia. We showed that point mutations in the conserved motif of 29 bp identified upstream of iscR decreased the cysteine-dependent repression of iscR mediated by IscRCp.

27000951|t|Prevalence and contamination levels of Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat foods in Tokyo, Japan.
27000951|a|UNASSIGNED: We surveyed prevalence and contamination levels of Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat foods between 2000 and 2012 in Tokyo. L. monocytogenes was isolated from 52 (1.7%) out of 2,980 samples. Comparing the prevalence in the study period, 2.2% were positive in the former period (2000-2005) and 1.2% in the latter (2006-2012). Using the most probable number (MPN) technique, 32 samples were contaminated with fewer than 0.3 L. monocytogenes /g, 10 samples with 0.3-1.0/g and 4 samples with more than 1.0/g (the maximum was 2.3/g). The most common serovar was 1/2a, followed by 1/2b, 4b   and 1/2c. We revealed that ready-to-eat foods in Tokyo were contaminated with L. monocytogenes, although the contamination levels were low.

27008368|t|Crystal Structure, Electronic Structure, and Photocatalytic Activity of Oxysulfides: La2Ta2ZrS2O8, La2Ta2TiS2O8, and La2Nb2TiS2O8.
27008368|a|UNASSIGNED: The novel oxysulfides La2Ta2ZrS2O8 (LTZSO), La2Ta2TiS2O8 (LTTSO), and La2Nb2TiS2O8 (LNTSO) were synthesized, and their crystal structures, electronic structures, and photocatalytic activities for water splitting under visible light were investigated. Density functional theory calculations showed that these compounds are direct-band-gap semiconductors. Close to the conduction band minimum, the main contribution to the band structure comes from the d orbitals of Zr or Ti ions, while the region near the valence band maximum is associated with the 3p orbitals of S ions. The absorption-edge wavelength was determined to be 540 nm for LTZSO and 700 nm for LTTSO and LNTSO. An analysis of the crystal structure using synchrotron X-ray diffraction revealed that these compounds contained antisite defects at transition metal ion sites, and these were considered to be the origin of the broad absorption at wavelengths longer than that corresponding to band-gap excitation. LTZSO was revealed to be active in the oxygen evolution reaction from aqueous solution containing a sacrificial electron acceptor under visible-light illumination. This result was supported by the band alignment and flat-band potential determined by photoelectron spectroscopy and Mott-Schottky plots.

27030512|t|Dysregulated 14-3-3 Family in Peripheral Blood Leukocytes of Patients with Schizophrenia.
27030512|a|The 14-3-3 family, which is composed of seven distinct members in humans, plays important roles in the cell cycle, apoptosis, synaptic plasticity and neuronal differentiation and migration. Previous genetic and post-mortem gene expression studies have linked this family to schizophrenia. However, the direction of gene expression changes in these studies has been inconsistent, and reports of 14-3-3 gene expression in living schizophrenic patients are still lacking. Here, we assessed 14-3-3 gene and protein expression levels in peripheral blood leukocytes from drug-na  ve first-episode schizophrenic patients and matched controls. mRNA and protein expression levels were quantified by qRT-PCR and UPLC-MRM/MS, respectively. Expression analysis revealed four downregulated and one upregulated mRNA transcripts as well as five downregulated protein levels of 14-3-3 isoforms in schizophrenia. Moreover, significant positive correlations between 14-3-3 mRNA and protein expression levels were found in schizophrenia, and we also identified negative correlations between   ,    and    isoform expression levels and positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Our results suggest that gene and protein expression levels for the 14-3-3 family are dysregulated in schizophrenia, perhaps owing to specific regulatory mechanisms, and we also suggest that expression of the 14-3-3  ,    and    isoform genes could be useful indicators of disease severity.

27025815|t|Measurement of Tear Production in English Angora and Dutch Rabbits.
27025815|a|The purpose of this study was to establish normal values for tear production tests in different breeds of domestic rabbits. Healthy adult rabbits (n = 60; 120 eyes) of 2 different breeds (English angora and Dutch; n = 15 of each sex and breed) were used in this study. Tear production was measured by using the 1-min Schirmer tear test (STT), phenol red thread test (PRTT), and endodontic absorbent paper point tear test (EAPTT). In addition, horizontal palpebral fissure length was evaluated as a measure of ocular adnexal dimensions. Tear production (mean    1 SD) in English angora rabbits was 5.4    1.6 mm/min according to the STT, 25.0    2.7 mm in 15 s for the PRTT, and 18.8    2.1 mm/min by the EAPTT; in Dutch rabbits, these values were 4.6    1.2 mm/min, 23.6    2.3 mm in 15 s, and 16.9    1.7 mm/min, respectively. Only the EAPTT revealed a significant difference in tear production between English Angora and Dutch rabbits. These results provide reference values for tear production in English Angora and Dutch rabbits according to 3 different quantitative tear film assessment methods.

27029956|t|The effect of quadriceps femoris muscle kinesio taping on physical fitness indices in non-injured athletes.
27029956|a|BACKGROUND: Evaluating the effect of kinesio taping of quadriceps femoris muscle on some physical fitness indices including maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), vertical jump, agility and sprint in healthy collegiate athletes. METHODS: Forty-four (23 male and 21 female) healthy collegiate athletes voluntarily participated in this study. The MVIC of quadriceps muscle (N) of the dominant leg was assessed by digital Dynamometer. vertical jump, agility and sprint was assessed using Sargent vertical jump, shuttle run agility and 30-yard sprint tests, respectively. All measures were obtained in 4 trails: control (without taping), two trials with 24 hours interval, immediately and 24 hours after tape application. Two conditions of with and without taping measures were performed by one week interval. Everybody was compared to themselves during different situations. Data was analyzed using SPSS software and ANOVA with repeated measure statistical test. RESULTS: MVIC, jumping and sprint performance significantly improved immediately and 24 hours following KT application compared to non KT conditions(P<0.05). Agility was improved 24 hours following taping (P<0.05), but KT caused no significant immediate effect on agility (P>0.05). 24 hours KT caused significant improvement in MVIC, jumping and agility performance, but caused no significant effect on sprint compared to immediately following taping. CONCLUSIONS: KT influenced positively MVIC, jumping, agility and sprint and the major effect was achieved by maintaining KT for 24hours in healthy athletes .. Although, regarding the study limitations, future studies are recommended for clarification.

27071189|t|Improve Glioblastoma Multiforme Prognosis Prediction by Using Feature Selection and Multiple Kernel Learning.
27071189|a|UNASSIGNED: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive type of brain cancer with very low median survival. In order to predict the patient's prognosis, researches have proposed rules to classify different glioma cancer cell subtypes. However, survival time of different subtypes of GBM is often various due to different individual basis. Recent development in gene testing has evolved classic subtype rules to more specific classification rules based on single biomolocular features. These classification methods are proven to perform better than traditional simple rules in GBM prognosis prediction. However, the real power behind the massive data is still uncovered. We believe a combined prediction model based on more than one data type could perform better which will contribute further to clinical treatment of GBM. The Cancer Genome Atlas(TCGA) database provides huge dataset with various data types of many cancers that enables us to inspect this aggressive cancer in a new way. In this research, we have improved GBM prognosis prediction accuracy further by take advantages of minimum redundancy feature selection method (mRMR) and Multiple Kernel Machine (MKL) learning method. Our goal is to build an integrated model which could predict GBM prognosis with high accuracy.

27008524|t|Quantum requirements for growth and fatty acid biosynthesis in the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum (Bacillariophyceae) in nitrogen replete and limited conditions.
27008524|a|We determined the quantum requirements for growth (1/    ) and fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis (1/  FA ) in the marine diatom, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, grown in nutrient replete conditions with nitrate or ammonium as nitrogen sources, and under nitrogen limitation, achieved by transferring cells into nitrogen free medium or by inhibiting nitrate assimilation with tungstate. A treatment in which tungstate was supplemented to cells grown with ammonium was also included. In nutrient replete conditions, cells grew exponentially and possessed virtually identical 1/    of 40-44  mol photons      mol C(-1) . In parallel, 1/  FA varied between 380 and 409  mol photons      mol C(-1) in the presence of nitrate, but declined to 348  mol photons      mol C(-1) with ammonium and to 250  mol photons      mol C(-1) with ammonium plus tungstate, indicating an increase in the efficiency of FA biosynthesis relative to cells grown on nitrate of 8% and 35%, respectively. While the molecular mechanism for this effect remains poorly understood, the results unambiguously reveal that cells grown on ammonium are able to direct more reductant to lipids. This analysis suggests that when cells are grown with a reduced nitrogen source, fatty acid biosynthesis can effectively become a sink for excess absorbed light, compensating for the absence of energetically demanding nitrate assimilation reactions. Our data further suggest that optimal lipid production efficiency is achieved when cells are in exponential growth, when nitrate assimilation is inhibited, and ammonium is the sole nitrogen source.

27079697|t|Tropical legume supplementation influences microbial protein synthesis and rumen ecology.
27079697|a|UNASSIGNED: Four rumen-fistulated male swamp buffaloes, 5-year-old with initiated live weight at 360      12  kg, were randomly assigned according to a 4  *  4 Latin square design to investigate the effect of feeding high level of dried Leucaena leaf (DLL) on feed intake, fermentation efficiency and microbial protein synthesis. The dietary treatments were the feeding levels of DLL at 0, 2, 4 and 6  kg/head/day. All buffaloes were supplemented with concentrate mixtures at 0.1% of body weight, and rice straw was fed ad  libitum with the availability of water and mineral block at all time. The results revealed that the total feed intake and nutrient digestibility were significantly improved with the increasing levels of DLL feeding, and the highest was in the buffaloes consuming DLL at 6  kg/head/day. Feeding high levels of DLL did not affect on ruminal pH and temperature, while ammonia nitrogen, blood urea nitrogen and volatile fatty acid concentration were significantly enhanced. Moreover, methane production was dramatically reduced by increasing levels of DLL feeding. Total direct counts of the micro-organism population were increased with the increasing levels of DLL feeding. According to the application of quantitative PCR to quantity cellulolytic bacteria (16S rRNA) targets, it was found that the population of total bacteria and Fibrobactor succinogenes was affected by treatments, while Ruminococcus flavefaciens and methanogen population were significantly decreased as buffaloes were fed with DLL. The nitrogen balance and microbial nitrogen supply were remarkably improved with the increasing levels of DLL feeding. Based on this study, it could be concluded that high levels of DLL feeding at 6  kg/head/day could enhance feed intake, nutrient digestibility, rumen fermentation efficiency and microbial protein synthesis in swamp buffaloes fed on rice straw without any adverse effect.

27076250|t|Recurrence of Waldenstr  m macroglobulinemia accompanied by factor X deficiency.
27076250|a|A medical check-up revealed severe anemia in an 85-year-old man who had been diagnosed with Waldenstr  m macroglobulinemia 11 years previously. On the other hand, prolonged PT and aPTT were demonstrated on admission, and were attributed to a significant decrease in factor X activity. These abnormalities were all considered to be have been caused by an exacerbation of the underlying disease and, thus, chemotherapy with the RCD regimen (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone) was started. No significant improvement was obtained and the patient died suddenly on day 154. AL amyloidosis was diagnosed by histopathological examinations and also confirmed by a sequence analysis of amyloid protein. This case with Waldenstr  m macroglobulinemia complicated by AL amyloidosis and recurrent factor X deficiency is quite rare.

27080376|t|Indirect Rapid Prototyping: Opening Up Unprecedented Opportunities in Scaffold Design and Applications.
27080376|a|UNASSIGNED: Over the past decades, solid freeform fabrication (SFF) has emerged as the main technology for the production of scaffolds for tissue engineering applications as a result of the architectural versatility. However, certain limitations have also arisen, primarily associated with the available, rather limited range of materials suitable for processing. To overcome these limitations, several research groups have been exploring novel methodologies through which a construct, generated via SFF, is applied as a sacrificial mould for production of the final construct. The technique combines the benefits of SFF techniques in terms of controlled, patient-specific design with a large freedom in material selection associated with conventional scaffold production techniques. Consequently, well-defined 3D scaffolds can be generated in a straightforward manner from previously difficult to print and even "unprintable" materials due to thermomechanical properties that do not match the often strict temperature and pressure requirements for direct rapid prototyping. These include several biomaterials, thermally degradable materials, ceramics and composites. Since it can be combined with conventional pore forming techniques, indirect rapid prototyping (iRP) enables the creation of a hierarchical porosity in the final scaffold with micropores inside the struts. Consequently, scaffolds and implants for applications in both soft and hard tissue regeneration have been reported. In this review, an overview of different iRP strategies and materials are presented from the first reports of the approach at the turn of the century until now.

27086975|t|Oxidative injury in multiple sclerosis cerebellar grey matter.
27086975|a|UNASSIGNED: Cerebellar dysfunction is a significant contributor to disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). Both white matter (WM) and grey matter (GM) injury occurs within MS cerebellum and, within GM, demyelination, inflammatory cell infiltration and neuronal injury contribute to on-going pathology. The precise nature of cerebellar GM injury is, however, unknown. Oxidative stress pathways with ultimate lipid peroxidation and cell membrane injury occur extensively in MS and the purpose of this study was to investigate these processes in MS cerebellar GM. Post-mortem human cerebellar GM from MS and control subjects was analysed immunohistochemically, followed by semi-quantitative analysis of markers of cellular injury, lipid peroxidation and anti-oxidant enzyme expression. We have shown evidence for reduction in myelin and neuronal markers in MS GM, coupled to an increase in expression of a microglial marker. We also show that the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal co-localises with myelin and its levels negatively correlate to myelin basic protein levels. Furthermore, superoxide dismutase (SOD1 and 2) enzymes, localised within cerebellar neurons, are up-regulated, yet the activation of subsequent enzymes responsible for the detoxification of hydrogen peroxide, catalase and glutathione peroxidase are relatively deficient. These studies provide evidence for oxidative injury in MS cerebellar GM and further help define disease mechanisms within the MS brain.

27067168|t|Does 3-Dimensional In  Vivo Component Rotation Affect Clinical Outcomes in Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty?
27067168|a|BACKGROUND: Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is an effective treatment for single-compartment osteoarthritis. Limited studies have examined the relationship between component rotation and functional outcomes, with no existing consensus to guide "optimal" UKA component rotation. Our study aims to study the effect of 3-dimensional (3D) in  vivo UKA component axial rotation on functional outcomes by determining (1) how much component axial rotation variability exists in UKA? and (2) does 3D in  vivo UKA component axial rotation affect functional outcomes? METHODS: Sixty-six UKAs from 58 consecutive patients (36 male [62.1%], age 63.7    9.2 years, body mass index 28.2    4.9 kg/m(2), and mean follow-up time 49.2 months) were imaged in weight-bearing standing position using biplanar radiography. We performed multiple comparisons to analyze the relationship between 3D UKA component alignment and European Quality of Life - 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), UCLA activity score, and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores. RESULTS: Significant improvements in EQ-5D, EQ-5D (United States adjusted), and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (Sport/Rec) scores were noted postoperatively. However, high variability in 3D UKA femoral (6.2      6.5  ) and tibial (4.6      6.4  ) component positioning was observed. A trend toward better outcome scores in lower angles of femoral (<2.7   external rotation [ER]) and tibial (2.7   ER to 2.4   internal rotation [IR]) component rotation was noted, with better functional scores observed at mean femoral and tibial rotation angles of 3   ER to 3   IR. CONCLUSION: Patients with UKA femoral and/or tibial component rotation angles within 3   ER to 3   IR of neutral component alignment reported better functional outcomes. Surgeons should be cognizant of the high variability noted in UKA component axial rotation and its potential correlation with functional scores.

27038190|t|Thought-shape fusion in young healthy females appears after vivid imagination of thin ideals.
27038190|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: It has been shown that exposure to female thin ideals in media has minimal to moderate direct effects on body image satisfaction (BIS), mood and dysfunctional eating in healthy young women. Evidence has been found for several intervening variables such as social comparison processes. Accordingly it is assumed, that cognitive processing (rather than mere media exposure) is crucial. Consequently, vivid imagination of thin ideals after exposure to a fashion magazine was induced in order to trigger cognitive processes. Changes in mood, BIS and resulting bodyrelated cognitive distortions (Thought-Shape Fusion Body, TSF-B) were assessed. METHODS: A total of 91 healthy women (mean age 21.9 years, SD  =  2.0) were exposed to either a fashion magazine (thin-ideal group) or a nature magazine (control group) in a waiting room design. Afterwards they were instructed to vividly imagine either the thin ideals or landscapes. RESULTS: When exposed to thin ideals, a significant decrease in mood and BIS emerged after vivid imagination, but not after mere magazine exposure. Imagining thin ideals triggered body-related cognitive distortions (TSF-B). A higher degree of eating disorder (ED) symptomatology amplified this effect. LIMITATIONS: These findings apply to young healthy females and cannot be generalized to samples with obesity, EDs or males. Internal validity is limited since the intensity of the exposure has not been systematically controlled. CONCLUSIONS: Vivid imagination of thin ideals promoted by magazines results in impaired mood and BIS and moreover in body-related cognitive distortions (TSF-B) in healthy women, especially, for those with stronger ED symptomatology.

27062301|t|Cortical phosphorylated a-Synuclein levels correlate with brain wave spectra in Parkinson's disease.
27062301|a|INTRODUCTION: Quantitative EEG features have been identified as surrogates and predictors of cognitive decline/dementia, a common feature of progressive PD. The biochemical correlates for altered quantitative EEG features are unknown. Our primary objective was to test the hypothesis that quantitative EEG measures correlate with cortical levels of phosphorylated a-synuclein, a modified form of the synaptic protein a-synuclein, in PD cases, in contrast to other pathology-associated proteins. A secondary objective was to explore the same correlations among cellular fractions of these proteins. METHODS: We used posterior cingulate cortex autopsy tissue from 44 PD subjects with various degrees of cognitive decline, who had undergone EEG. In this brain region, which is a major hub of the default mode network, biochemical measurements for levels of phosphorylated a-synuclein, unmodified a-synuclein, amyloid beta peptide, phosphorylated tau, and key synaptic proteins were analyzed and data correlated with spectral EEG measures. RESULTS: Findings revealed significant correlations between background rhythm peak frequency and all bandpower values (highest in delta bandpower) with total phosphorylated a-synuclein, but not any correlation with total a-synuclein, phosphorylated tau protein, amyloid beta peptide, or synaptic proteins. Certain fractions of synaptosomal-associated protein 25 showed correlation with some quantitative EEG measures. CONCLUSIONS: These data show an association between increased phosphorylation of a-synuclein and the abnormal EEG signatures of cognitive decline. Results suggest that quantitative EEG may provide an in vivo approximation of phosphorylated a-synuclein in PD cortex. This adds to previous evidence that quantitative EEG measures can be considered valid biomarkers of PD cognitive decline.    2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

27037936|t|Diagnostic and Prognostic Factors for Acute Encephalopathy.
27037936|a|BACKGROUND: Acute encephalopathy is disease with the possibility of sequelae. While early treatment is required to prevent the development of sequelae, a differential diagnosis is of utmost priority. Then we have investigated the parameters that can be applied to make early diagnosis and predict prognosis of acute encephalopathy. METHODS: We reviewed the medical charts of the inpatients from 2005 to 2011 and found out that 33 patients attended to our institute because of febrile status epilepticus. We classified subjects into an acute encephalopathy group (20 patients) and a febrile convulsion group (13 patients), and compared the parameters (serum AST, ALT, LDH, NH3, CSF tau protein, CSF IL-6) between them. Furthermore, the relationship between each parameters and prognosis was investigated in the encephalopathy group. RESULTS: Significant differences in serum AST, ALT, and LDH were observed between febrile convulsion and acute encephalopathy group. Moreover, significant differences in serum LDH was noted between the patients with regression at the time of hospital discharge and without regression in the encephalopathy group. In particular, CSF tau protein was determined to be highly likely to indicate progress with poor prognosis leading to regression if high levels of >1000   pg/dL was exhibited. CONCLUSION: Serum AST, ALT and LDH may be related to the early diagnosis and prognosis and should be carefully investigated in patients with encephalopathy. Besides, CSF tau protein could be applied as the indicator of poor prognosis in acute encephalopathy.

27053136|t|Cohort profile: the German Diabetes Study (GDS).
27053136|a|BACKGROUND: The German Diabetes Study (GDS) is a prospective longitudinal cohort study describing the impact of subphenotypes on the course of the disease. GDS aims at identifying prognostic factors and mechanisms underlying the development of related comorbidities. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The study comprises intensive phenotyping within 12  months after clinical diagnosis, at 5-year intervals for 20  years and annual telephone interviews in between. Dynamic tests, including glucagon, mixed meal, intravenous glucose tolerance and hyperinsulinemic clamp tests, serve to assess beta-cell function and tissue-specific insulin sensitivity. Magnetic resonance imaging and multinuclei spectroscopy allow quantifying whole-body fat distribution, tissue-specific lipid deposition and energy metabolism. Comprehensive analyses of microvascular (nerve, eye, kidney) and macrovascular (endothelial, cardiorespiratory) morphology and function enable identification and monitoring of comorbidities. The GDS biobank stores specimens from blood, stool, skeletal muscle, subcutaneous adipose tissue and skin for future analyses including multiomics, expression profiles and histology. Repeated questionnaires on socioeconomic conditions, patient-reported outcomes as quality of life, health-related behavior as physical activity and nutritional habits are a specific asset of GDS. This study will recruit 3000 patients  and a group of humans without familiy history of diabetes. 237 type 1 and 456 type 2 diabetes patients have been already included.

27043927|t|Prognostic value of midtreatment FDG-PET in oropharyngeal cancer.
27043927|a|BACKGROUND: Prognostic metabolic imaging indices are needed for risk stratification for patients with locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer. METHODS: We retrospectively examined pretreatment and midtreatment fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) parameters in patients with locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer who were treated with definitive chemoradiation. RESULTS: A total of 74 patients were evaluated. Pretreatment metabolic tumor volume (MTV) using threshold of 50% standardized uptake value (SUV) maximum (MTV50% ) was associated with progression-free survival (PFS; p = .003; hazard ratio [HR] = 1.57 per 10 cc; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.17-2.11) and overall survival (OS; p = .01; HR = 1.36 per 10 cc; 95% CI = 1.07-1.74). Midtreatment MTV using a threshold of SUV 2.0 (MTV2.0 ) was associated with PFS (p < .001; HR = 1.24 per 10 cc; 95% CI = 1.10-1.39) and OS (p = .009; HR = 1.21 per 10 cc; 95% CI = 1.05-1.39). Nodal total lesion glycolysis (TLG) velocity >5% decrease/week was associated with improved PFS (p = .04; HR = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.15-0.95). CONCLUSION: Metabolic response during chemoradiation is associated with survival in locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer and may aid with risk-adapting treatment.    2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

27058544|t|Data Collection for Mobile Group Consumption: An Asynchronous Distributed Approach.
27058544|a|UNASSIGNED: Mobile group consumption refers to consumption by a group of people, such as a couple, a family, colleagues and friends, based on mobile communications. It differs from consumption only involving individuals, because of the complex relations among group members. Existing data collection systems for mobile group consumption are centralized, which has the disadvantages of being a performance bottleneck, having single-point failure and increasing business and security risks. Moreover, these data collection systems are based on a synchronized clock, which is often unrealistic because of hardware constraints, privacy concerns or synchronization cost. In this paper, we propose the first asynchronous distributed approach to collecting data generated by mobile group consumption. We formally built a system model thereof based on asynchronous distributed communication. We then designed a simulation system for the model for which we propose a three-layer solution framework. After that, we describe how to detect the causality relation of two/three gathering events that happened in the system based on the collected data. Various definitions of causality relations based on asynchronous distributed communication are supported. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed approach is effective for data collection relating to mobile group consumption.

27014948|t|The Problem with Having Two Watches: Assessment of Fit When RMSEA and CFI Disagree.
27014948|a|UNASSIGNED: The root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and the comparative fit index (CFI) are two widely applied indices to assess fit of structural equation models. Because these two indices are viewed positively by researchers, one might presume that their values would yield comparable qualitative assessments of model fit for any data set. When RMSEA and CFI offer different evaluations of model fit, we argue that researchers are likely to be confused and potentially make incorrect research conclusions. We derive the necessary as well as the sufficient conditions for inconsistent interpretations of these indices. We also study inconsistency in results for RMSEA and CFI at the sample level. Rather than indicating that the model is misspecified in a particular manner or that there are any flaws in the data, the two indices can disagree because (a) they evaluate, by design, the magnitude of the model's fit function value from different perspectives; (b) the cutoff values for these indices are arbitrary; and (c) the meaning of "good" fit and its relationship with fit indices are not well understood. In the context of inconsistent judgments of fit using RMSEA and CFI, we discuss the implications of using cutoff values to evaluate model fit in practice and to design SEM studies.

27112415|t|Early loading of delayed versus immediately placed implants in the anterior mandible: A pilot comparative clinical study.
27112415|a|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Numerous studies of the efficacy of immediately placed implants have been published but only a few of the comparative analyses of the early loading of delayed versus immediately placed dental implants. PURPOSE: The purpose of this pilot prospective clinical study was to evaluate and compare the outcomes of early loaded delayed versus immediately placed implants. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty-eight participants satisfying predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected for this pilot prospective study of 3 years' duration after obtaining institutional review board approval and informed consent. The immediate and the delayed implant placement group each consisted of 44 participants. The anterior mandible canine region was the implant placement site for all participants, and all implants were of the same size and manufacture. Participants were evaluated for hard (crestal bone loss and stability) and soft (periimplant probing depth) tissue implant success parameters at 6 and 12 months after implant placement. Data were analyzed, and results were computed. RESULTS: Intergroup comparisons for mean mesial, mean distal, and mean crestal bone loss at 6 and 12 months after immediate and delayed implant placement showed statistically insignificant differences (P>= .05). Intergroup comparisons of mean mesial, mean distal, mean labial, and mean lingual and mean pocket depth at 6 and 12 months also showed statistically insignificant differences (P>= .05). Comparative mean values using the Periotest also demonstrated statistically insignificant differences (P>= .05). CONCLUSIONS: The short-term outcomes of early loaded delayed and immediately placed implants were comparable. Therefore, early loaded immediately placed implants may be a promising option for the mandibular anterior region.

27111487|t|[Multicentric lymphoma in 411 dogs - an epidemiological study].
27111487|a|OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of the epidemiology of canine multicentric lymphoma in Germany. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 411 dogs with multicentric malignant lymphoma were retrospectively analysed regarding breed, age, sex, weight and the number of animals dogs with hypercalcaemic lymphoma and B-/T-immunophenotype, and compared to two reference populations (total own clinic population, n=52142; dogs with health insurance in Germany, n=123423). RESULTS: In total, 298 (72.5%) of the 411 dogs belonged to 86 different breeds, while 113 (27.5%) dogs were mixed breed. In comparison to both reference populations, a breed predisposition for the American Pitbull Terrier (odds ratio [OR] 5.2 and 18.5), American Staffordshire Terrier (OR 3.3 and 4.6), Briard (OR 5.6 and 9.5), Bullmastiff (OR 7.8 and 5.0), Irish Setter (OR 3.3 and 4.1) and Rottweiler (OR 2.8 and 3.6) was found. Golden Retrievers (n  =  22, OR 1.3 and 0.9) and Bernese Mountain Dogs (n  =  22, OR 2.4 and 2.0) were frequently affected in absolute numbers, but when compared to the reference populations an OR < 3 was detected. Mean body weight was 30.2      13.7  kg; only 75 (18%) dogs weighed <  15  kg. Amongst the small dogs (<  15  kg), there was a large number of West Highland White Terriers (n  =  12). Mean age of the dogs with lymphoma was 7.9      2.7  years. Dogs weighing >=  15 kg were significantly (p < 0.001) younger (7.6     2.4  years) compared to dogs weighing <  15  kg (9.3      3.2  years). Dogs with a B-cell immunophenotype (8.5      2.6  years) were significantly older compared to dogs with a T-cell immunophenotype (6.4     1.8  years) (p  <  0.001). There was no gender predisposition (54% male, 46% female). Hypercalcaemia as an indicator of T-cell lymphoma was present in 44 (11.4%) of the dogs. A T-cell and B-cell immunophenotype was found in 20.6% and 79.4% of the dogs, respectively. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study confirms previous data about breed predispositions for canine malignant multicentric lymphoma and demonstrates that further breeds are predisposed (Briard, West Highland White Terrier, Irish Setter). Small-breed dogs (<  15  kg BM) appear to be affected with lymphoma at a greater age.

27015488|t|Sudden Viscous Dissipation of Compressing Turbulence.
27015488|a|UNASSIGNED: Compression of turbulent plasma can amplify the turbulent kinetic energy, if the compression is fast compared to the viscous dissipation time of the turbulent eddies. A sudden viscous dissipation mechanism is demonstrated, whereby this amplified turbulent kinetic energy is rapidly converted into thermal energy, suggesting a new paradigm for fast ignition inertial fusion.

27015336|t|Nipple Resection and Reconstruction After Attempted Nipple-Sparing Mastectomy.
27015336|a|BACKGROUND: Occult nipple malignancy is detected in 0% to 58% of attempted nipple-sparing mastectomies (NSM), prompting excision of the nipple. We report our experience with nipple resection following attempted NSM and our outcomes with subsequent nipple reconstruction. METHODS: An institutional review board-approved retrospective review was performed of attempted NSM cases with immediate implant-based reconstruction from July 2006 to April 2015. Patients who underwent nipple excision were identified. Indications for excision, pathology reports, and reconstructive outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS: Five hundred sixty-eight NSMs were performed in 330 patients. Thirty-four (6%) cases underwent nipple excision, 53% for positive frozen sections, 29% for positive permanent sections, 3% for clinical suspicion, and 15% either at patient request or for symmetry. All of the cases with positive frozen sections had disease on permanent section and 56% had residual disease in the resection specimen. Of the cases with positive permanent sections, frozen sections were negative in 50%, suspicious or atypical in 30%, and not sent in 20% of cases. Thirty percent had residual disease in the resection specimen. Frozen section sensitivity was 64% (or 75% if suspicious and atypical findings are included). There were no false-positive results on frozen section. Sixty-eight percent of cases have undergone nipple reconstruction by CV flap (57%), skate flap (39%), or nipple-sharing technique (4%). The aesthetic result after reconstruction was excellent in 83% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the benefit of intraoperative subareolar frozen section for detection of occult disease. When nipple excision is required, patients can still achieve an excellent aesthetic result with reconstruction.

27013844|t|Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy in a Lung Transplant Recipient: Isolation of John Cunningham (JC) Virus from Bronchoalveolar Lavage.
27013844|a|Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system caused by polyomavirus John Cunningham (JC) virus. We report the case of a 60-year-old woman who presented 16 months after right single lung transplant with worsening memory, behavioral problems, emotional lability, and progressive left upper extremity weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed white matter changes suggestive of PML. JC virus infection was confirmed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from both the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and cerebrospinal fluid. To our knowledge, this is the first report of PCR isolation of JC virus from a BAL specimen. We also review the two additional cases in the literature that describe PML after lung transplantation. JC virus infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of lung transplant recipients who develop neurological symptoms. BAL may have a role in the etiologic diagnosis of PML after lung transplantation.

27111397|t|Emphysematous pyometra secondary to Enterococcus avium infection in a dog.
27111397|a|UNASSIGNED: A 5-year-old female intact Mastiff dog was presented with a history of vaginal discharge for 1 day. Physical examination revealed a sanguineo-purulent vaginal discharge and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Abdominal radiographs showed several dilated and gas-filled tubular loops. The differential diagnoses included emphysematous pyometra or small intestinal mechanical ileus. Surgical exploration of the abdomen demonstrated a severely dilated and gas-filled uterus, and emphysematous pyometra was confirmed. The patient's clinical signs resolved after ovariohysterectomy. Histopathology revealed mild endometrial cystic hyperplasia with infiltration of inflammatory cells in the superficial endometrial epithelia. Enterococcus avium, an a-hemolytic gram-positive coccus, was isolated from the uterus. This paper highlights the radiographic features of emphysematous pyometra and a pathogen that has never been reported to be associated with canine pyometra previously.

27087698|t|Perceptions of 'Evidence-Based Practice' among the Consumers of Adolescent Substance Use Treatment.
27087698|a|OBJECTIVE: Several national organisations in the USA have recently developed educational materials that encourage substance use disorder treatment consumers to seek out approaches supported by scientific evidence in order to promote the use of "evidence-based practice" (EBP). This study aimed to explore how adolescents (young people age 12-17 years) with substance use disorders and their caregivers perceive, understand, and react to the concept of EBP. METHODS: Qualitative focus groups and structured interviews were conducted with 29 caregivers and 24 adolescents with substance use disorders in the Northeastern USA. Discussions explored four themes: a) familiarity with EBP, b) assumptions about what EBP means, c) impressions of EBP after reading a common definition, and d) recommended terms to describe EBP in educational materials. Participants' responses were transcribed and qualitatively analysed by two independent coders. RESULTS: Only two of the 53 participants had ever heard the term EBP, and only one was able to define it correctly. Common assumptions about the term "evidence-based" were that it referred to treatment based on the patient's medical history, legal evidence of substance use, or the clinician's prior experience. The misperception that EBP was associated with legal evidence was common among adolescents involved in the justice system. After reading a common definition of EBP, most participants thought that the approach sounded inflexible. Alternative terms the participants recommended to educate potential treatment consumers about EBP included proven, successful, better, and therapy that works. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that future efforts to educate treatment consumers should use the phrase EBP with caution and emphasise the flexibility of the approach.

27015549|t|Hedgehog pathway maintains cell survival under stress conditions, and drives drug resistance in lung adenocarcinoma.
27015549|a|UNASSIGNED: Hedgehog (HH) pathway plays an important role in embryonic development, but is largely inactive in adult except for tissue repair. Aberrant activation of HH pathway has been found in a variety of cancer types. In non-small cell lung cancer, however, the role and importance of HH pathway remain controversial. In the current study, we found that HH pathway was maintained in low activity in lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) cells under normal culture condition, but was highly induced in response to stress conditions. Activation of HH pathway promoted cell survival, growth, and invasion partially through HGF and MET signaling. Hedgehog-Interacting Protein (HHIP), a cell-surface negative regulator of HH pathway, was epigenetically silenced in LAC. Overexpression of HHIP blocked the activation of HH and HGF/MET pathways, and made cells significantly more susceptible to stress conditions. In LAC cells with acquired resistance to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosin Kinase Inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), we found that a part of tumor cells were much more sensitive to HH or HGF/MET inhibitors, suggesting an oncogenic addiction shift from EGFR to HH and HGF/MET pathways. In conclusion, this study showed that HH pathway is a survival signaling that drives LAC cell growth under stress conditions, and HHIP is a key regulator to block the induction of HH pathway. Targeting the HH pathway through inhibitors or HHIP thus holds promise to address EGFR-TKI resistance in LAC in clinic.

27014477|t|Update on three-dimensional image reconstruction for preoperative simulation in thoracic surgery.
27014477|a|BACKGROUND: Three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) technologies have been developed and refined over time. Recently, high-speed and high-quality 3D-CT technologies have also been introduced to the field of thoracic surgery. The purpose of this manuscript is to demonstrate several examples of these 3D-CT technologies in various scenarios in thoracic surgery. METHODS: A newly-developed high-speed and high-quality 3D image analysis software system was used in Kyoto University Hospital. Simulation and/or navigation were performed using this 3D-CT technology in various thoracic surgeries. RESULTS: Preoperative 3D-CT simulation was performed in most patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Anatomical variation was frequently detected preoperatively, which was useful in performing VATS procedures when using only a monitor for vision. In sublobar resection, 3D-CT simulation was more helpful. In small lung lesions, which were supposedly neither visible nor palpable, preoperative marking of the lesions was performed using 3D-CT simulation, and wedge resection or segmentectomy was successfully performed with confidence. This technique also enabled virtual-reality endobronchial ultrasonography (EBUS), which made the procedure more safe and reliable. Furthermore, in living-donor lobar lung transplantation (LDLLT), surgical procedures for donor lobectomy were simulated preoperatively by 3D-CT angiography, which also affected surgical procedures for recipient surgery. New surgical techniques such as right and left inverted LDLLT were also established using 3D models created with this technique. CONCLUSIONS: After the introduction of 3D-CT technology to the field of thoracic surgery, preoperative simulation has been developed for various thoracic procedures. In the near future, this technique will become more common in thoracic surgery, and frequent use by thoracic surgeons will be seen in worldwide daily practice.

27056656|t|Decongestion: Diuretics and other therapies for hospitalized heart failure.
27056656|a|Acute heart failure (AHF) is a potentially life-threatening clinical syndrome, usually requiring hospital admission. Often the syndrome is characterized by congestion, and is associated with long hospital admissions and high risk of readmission and further healthcare expenditure. Despite a limited evidence-base, diuretics remain the first-line treatment for congestion. Loop diuretics are typically the first-line diuretic strategy with some evidence that initial treatment with continuous infusion or boluses of high-dose loop diuretic is superior to an initial lower dose strategy. In patients who have impaired responsiveness to diuretics, the addition of an oral thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic to induce sequential nephron blockade can be beneficial. The use of intravenous low-dose dopamine is no longer supported in heart failure patients with preserved systolic blood pressure and its use to assist diuresis in patients with low systolic blood pressures requires further study. Mechanical ultrafiltration has been used to treat patients with heart failure and fluid retention, but the evidence-base is not robust, and its place in clinical practice is yet to be established. Several novel pharmacological agents remain under investigation.

27073179|t|No significant effect of cannabis use on the count and percentage of circulating CD4 T-cells in HIV-HCV co-infected patients (ANRS CO13-HEPAVIH French cohort).
27073179|a|INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Despite cannabis use being very common in patients co-infected with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV), its effect on these patients' immune systems remains undocumented. Documenting the potential effect of cannabis use on HIV immunological markers would help caregivers make more targeted health recommendations to co-infected patients. We performed a longitudinal analysis of the relationship between cannabis use and peripheral blood CD4 T-cell measures in co-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. DESIGN AND METHODS: Cannabis use was assessed using annual self-administered questionnaires in 955 patients (2386 visits) enrolled in the ANRS CO13-HEPAVIH cohort. The effect of cannabis use on circulating CD4 T-cell count and percentage was estimated using multivariate linear regression models with generalised estimating equations. Sensitivity analyses were conducted after excluding visits where (i) tobacco use and (ii) smoking >=10 tobacco cigarettes/day were reported. RESULTS: At the first visit, 48% of patients reported cannabis use during the previous four weeks, and 58% of these patients also smoked >= 10 tobacco cigarettes/day. After multiple adjustment, cannabis use was not significantly associated with either circulating CD4 T-cell count [model coefficient (95% confidence interval): 0.27 (-0.07; 0.62), P   =   0.12] or percentage [-0.04 (-0.45; 0.36), P   =   0.83]. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these results. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Findings show no evidence for a negative effect of cannabis use on circulating CD4 T-cell counts/percentages in HIV-HCV co-infected patients. In-depth immunological studies are needed to document whether cannabis has a harmful effect on CD4 levels in lungs and on cells' functional properties.

27011811|t|Patient-reported outcome measures for hip preservation surgery-a systematic review of the literature.
27011811|a|Hip preservation surgery is rapidly advancing and patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures are becoming an integral part of measuring treatment effectiveness. Traditionally the modified Harris hip score has been used as the main outcome measure. More recently, new PRO tools in the field have been developed. We performed a systematic review of the English literature from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and SPORTDiscus databases to identify the PRO tools used in hip preservation surgery. Our aim was to critically appraise the quality of the questionnaire properties in order to recommend the most appropriate PRO tool for future use. Measurement properties of each PRO questionnaire were rated from excellent to poor, based on Terwee criteria and the results from the included studies. Six PRO tools were identified with description or comparison of their measurement properties in 10 articles. While, most recently developed PRO tools, the hip outcome score (HOS), the Copenhagen hip and groin outcome score (HAGOS) and the international hip outcome tool (iHOT-33) scored better than the others in their measurement properties, iHOT-33 scored the best of all the PRO tools and is recommended for future use in hip preservation surgery.

27045194|t|Cell separation: Potentials and pitfalls.
27045194|a|UNASSIGNED: Cell separation techniques play an indispensable part in numerous basic biological studies and even clinical settings. Although various cell isolation methods with diverse applications have been devised so far, not all of them have been able to gain widespread popularity among researchers and clinicians. There is not a single method known to be advantageous over all cell isolation techniques and in fact, it is the researcher's aim of a study that determines the most suitable method. A perfect method for one study might not be necessarily a proper choice for another and likewise, expensive and complex isolation methods might not always be the best choices. There are several criteria such as cell purity, viability, activation status, frequency, etc. that need to be given serious thought before selecting an isolation technique. Moreover, time and cost are two of the key elements that should be taken into consideration prior to implementing a project. Hence, here we provide a succinct description of six more popular cell separation methods with respect to their principles, advantages and disadvantages as well as their most common applications. We further provide several key features of each technique so that it helps the researchers to take the first step towards opting for the best method that fits well into their projects.

27027241|t|A systematic review on in vitro 3d bone metastases models. A new horizon to recapitulate the native clinical scenario?
27027241|a|UNASSIGNED: While the skeleton is not the only organ where metastasis can occur, it is one of the preferred sites, with a significant impact in patients' quality of life. With the aim of delineating the cellular and molecular mechanisms of bone metastasis, numerous studies have been employed to identify any contributing factors that trigger cancer progression. One of the major limitations of studying cancer-bone metastasis is the multifaceted nature of the native bone environment and the lack of reliable, simple, and not expensive models that strictly mimic the biological processes occurring in vivo allowing a correct translation of results. Currently, with the growing acceptance of in vitro models as effective tools for studying cancer biology, three-dimensional (3D) models have emerged as a compromise between two-dimensional cultures of isolated cancer cells and the complexity of human cancer xenografts in immunocompromised animal hosts. This descriptive systematic literature review summarizes the current status of advanced and alternative 3D in vitro bone metastases models. We have also reviewed the strategies employed by researchers to set-up these models with special reference to recent promising developments trying to better replicate the complexity and heterogeneity of a human metastasis in situ, with an outlook at their use in medicine. All these aspects will greatly contribute to the existing knowledge on bone metastases, providing a specific link to clinical scenarios and thus making 3D in vitro bone metastasis models an attractive tool for multidisciplinary experts.

27077568|t|Usefulness of robotic gait training plus neuromodulation in chronic spinal cord injury: a case report.
27077568|a|CONTEXT: Spinal cord injury (SCI) affects more than 2.5 million people worldwide, often leading to severe disability. Thus, a proper management of individuals with SCI is required either in the acute or in the post-acute rehabilitative phase. FINDINGS: A 31-year-old man, affected by chronic SCI, underwent two different intensive rehabilitation treatments, including either LokomatPro or a paired LokomatPro-rTMS training. We evaluated the clinical, kinetic, and electrophysiological parameters before and after each training session. In particular, the intensive robotic training was articulated in a total of 40 one-hour training sessions (i.e. 5 times a week for 8 weeks), whereas the rTMS sessions were delivered 3 days per week for 3 consecutive weeks, just before the LokomatPro session. Only at the end of the experimental treatment, we observed an important improvement in nearly all parameters we investigated. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The combined LokomatPro-rTMS rehabilitation may be a valuable approach in improving the motor function in patients affected by SCI, even in the chronic phase.

27039895|t|Differential expression of microRNAs in bovine papillomavirus type 1 transformed equine cells.
27039895|a|UNASSIGNED: Bovine papillomavirus (BPV) types 1 and 2 play an important role in the pathogenesis of equine sarcoids (ES), the most common cutaneous tumour affecting horses. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs that regulate essential biological and cellular processes, have been found dysregulated in a wide range of tumours. The aim of this study was to identify miRNAs associated with ES. Differential expression of miRNAs was assessed in control equine fibroblasts (EqPalFs) and EqPalFs transformed with the BPV-1 genome (S6-2 cells). Using a commercially available miRNA microarray, 492 mature miRNAs were interrogated. In total, 206 mature miRNAs were differentially expressed in EqPalFs compared with S6-2 cells. Aberrant expression of these miRNAs in S6-2 cells can be attributed to the presence of BPV-1 genomes. Furthermore, we confirm the presence of 124 miRNAs previously computationally predicted in the horse. Our data supports the involvement of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of ES.

27014083|t|Sudden Cardiac Risk Stratification with Electrocardiographic Indices - A Review on Computational Processing, Technology Transfer, and Scientific Evidence.
27014083|a|Great effort has been devoted in recent years to the development of sudden cardiac risk predictors as a function of electric cardiac signals, mainly obtained from the electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. But these prediction techniques are still seldom used in clinical practice, partly due to its limited diagnostic accuracy and to the lack of consensus about the appropriate computational signal processing implementation. This paper addresses a three-fold approach, based on ECG indices, to structure this review on sudden cardiac risk stratification. First, throughout the computational techniques that had been widely proposed for obtaining these indices in technical literature. Second, over the scientific evidence, that although is supported by observational clinical studies, they are not always representative enough. And third, via the limited technology transfer of academy-accepted algorithms, requiring further meditation for future systems. We focus on three families of ECG derived indices which are tackled from the aforementioned viewpoints, namely, heart rate turbulence (HRT), heart rate variability (HRV), and T-wave alternans. In terms of computational algorithms, we still need clearer scientific evidence, standardizing, and benchmarking, siting on advanced algorithms applied over large and representative datasets. New scenarios like electronic health recordings, big data, long-term monitoring, and cloud databases, will eventually open new frameworks to foresee suitable new paradigms in the near future.

27065706|t|The Initial Indian Experience with Cytoreductive Surgery and HIPEC in the Treatment of Peritoneal Metastases.
27065706|a|Worldwide, cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has been used for nearly 3 decades to treat peritoneal metastases (PM), improve quality of life, and prolong survival substantially in selected patients. In India, the use of the combined modality of treatment dates back a decade with majority of the efforts taking place within the last 5  years. The first PSOGI workshop (India) held in April 2015, at Bangalore, India offered an opportunity for Indian surgeons performing CRS and HIPEC to share their experience. To study the methodologies of CRS and HIPEC (hospital set up, equipment, training and surgical background) as well as the outcomes in terms of perioperative morbidity and mortality and short and long term survival of patients treated in India, Indian surgeons who had treated at least 10 patients with this combined modality were invited to present their experience. Data collection was retrospective. Analysis of the pooled data was carried out. Eight surgeons treated 384 patients with CRS and HIPEC over a period of 10  years. The commonest primary sites were ovary (as first line therapy n  =  124), followed by appendix, including pseudomyxoma peritonei (n  =  99), colorectum (n  =  77), recurrent ovary (as second line therapy, n  =  33), stomach (n  =  15), primary peritoneal cancer (n  =  10), peritoneal mesothelioma (n  =  9) and rare tumors in 17 patients. The weighted mean PCI for all 384 patients was 18.25. 349/384 patients (90.88  %) had a complete cytoreduction (completeness of cytoreduction score of CC-0/1). Grade 3-5 complications developed in 108 patients (27.34  %) and 30  day mortality occurred in 28 (7.29  %) patients. This study showed that CRS and HIPEC can be performed with an acceptable morbidity and mortality in Indian patients. Most of the surgeons are on the learning curve and further improvement in these outcomes is expected over a period of time. Pooling of data related to both common and rare peritoneal cancers would be useful in knowing the disease behavior, response to treatment and outcomes in Indian patients. The 2015 PSOGI meeting provided a unique platform for data presentation with feedback from international experts in the field of peritoneal surface oncology. Future meetings are planned to expand the evaluation of Indian data and progress.

27093470|t|Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exposure, miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism, and heart rate variability in coke oven workers.
27093470|a|BACKGROUND: Exposure to ubiquitous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has been associated with decreased heart rate variability (HRV). Evidence accumulates that microRNAs (miRNAs) might be the intermediate factors between environmental exposures and their adverse health effects. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNA genes may affect phenotypes and disease morbidity. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the influences of four well-studied SNPs in miRNA genes (rs2910164, rs11614913, rs2292832, and rs3746444) on HRV, and their modifying effects on the associations between PAH exposure and HRV. METHODS: We measured the concentrations of ten urinary monohydroxy PAHs (OH-PAHs), seven HRV parameters, and genotypes of these four SNPs in 1222 coke oven workers. RESULTS: There were significant differences among different rs2910164 genotype carriers in terms of all seven HRV indices: workers with rs2910164 CC genotype had significant lower HRV than those with GG or GC genotype (P<0.05). The number of rs2910164 C allele was negatively associated with HRV indices in the high PAH exposure group (b<0, P<0.05), and the association between rs2910164 and high-frequency (HF) power was significantly stronger in high exposure group (Pinteraction=0.042). Interestingly, the negative associations between the sum of 10 OH-PAHs and HRV (b<0, P<0.05) were significantly or marginally significantly stronger in workers with rs2910164 CC genotype (Pinteraction <=0.050). CONCLUSIONS: Coke oven workers with miR-146a rs2910164 CC genotype may be more susceptible to decreased HRV. The modifying effect of rs2910164 on the PAHs-HRV associations suggested miR-146a may mediate the effects of PAH exposure on HRV.

27013076|t|How serotonin receptors regulate morphogenic signalling in neurons.
27013076|a|UNASSIGNED: Serotonin (5-hydroxytrympamine or 5-HT) is one of the phylogenetically oldest neurotransmitters, and the serotonergic system is among the earliest developed neuronal systems. Serotonin is critically involved in regulating multiple physiological functions, acting via a heterogenic receptor family that includes G protein-coupled receptors and ligand-gated ion channels. Although serotonergic neurons comprise a widely distributed and complex network that targets nearly every brain structure, serotonin-mediated signalling is under strict temporal and spatial control. Imbalance in serotonergic signalling is implicated in many pathophysiological conditions, including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, depression, and anxiety. In addition to its well-established role as a neurotransmitter, serotonin is involved in many aspects of neural development, including neurite outgrowth, somatic morphology regulation, growth cone motility, synaptogenesis, and control of dendritic spine shape and density. The morphogenic effects of serotonin are developmentally regulated, and serotonin availability during sensitive developmental stages can modulate the formation and functions of behaviourally relevant neuronal networks in adulthood. Here we provide an overview of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the morphogenic effects of serotonin elicited by its different receptors in neurons. We also discuss the role of serotonin receptor-mediated morphogenic signalling in the development and maintenance of pathophysiological conditions.

27003266|t|Current practice of preconception care by primary caregivers in the Netherlands.
27003266|a|OBJECTIVES: Over the past decade the value of preconception care (PCC) consultations has been acknowledged. Investments have been made to promote delivery and uptake of PCC consultations in the Dutch primary care setting. We assessed current activities, perceptions and prerequisites for delivery of PCC in primary care. METHODS: A questionnaire was compiled and distributed by mail or e-mail among 1682 general practitioners (GPs) and 746 midwives in the Netherlands between 2013 and 2014. RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 449 GPs and 250 midwives. While GPs and midwives were frequently asked about preconception risks, explicit requests by patients for a PCC consultation were less frequent. Although caregivers gave information on preconception risk factors, only a minority recommended PCC in the form of a dedicated consultation. Such consultations occurred infrequently. Risk factor assessment varied between GPs and midwives. Respondents' perceptions of PCC consultations, however, were generally positive. A small proportion believed that PCC medicalised pregnancy, and recognised barriers in actively raising the topic of patients' pregnancy wishes. More training, staff, promotion of PCC and adequate reimbursement were prerequisites for future delivery. GPs differed in their opinion of whether they or midwives were primarily responsible for PCC consultations. Midwives, however, saw themselves as responsible for providing PCC consultations. CONCLUSIONS: Primary care is underserving prospective parents with regards to PCC consultations. Targets to increase delivery of systematic PCC are: (1) promotion during routine care; (2) increased use of tools; (3) increased collaboration among primary caregivers; (4) reduction of caregivers' negative perceptions; and (5) tailoring PCC consultations to suit women's preferences.

27005614|t|Proteomic Analysis Reveals the Leaf Color Regulation Mechanism in Chimera Hosta "Gold Standard" Leaves.
27005614|a|Leaf color change of variegated leaves from chimera species is regulated by fine-tuned molecular mechanisms. Hosta "Gold Standard" is a typical chimera Hosta species with golden-green variegated leaves, which is an ideal material to investigate the molecular mechanisms of leaf variegation. In this study, the margin and center regions of young and mature leaves from Hosta "Gold Standard", as well as the leaves from plants after excess nitrogen fertilization were studied using physiological and comparative proteomic approaches. We identified 31 differentially expressed proteins in various regions and development stages of variegated leaves. Some of them may be related to the leaf color regulation in Hosta "Gold Standard". For example, cytosolic glutamine synthetase (GS1), heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), and chloroplastic elongation factor G (cpEF-G) were involved in pigment-related nitrogen synthesis as well as protein synthesis and processing. By integrating the proteomics data with physiological results, we revealed the metabolic patterns of nitrogen metabolism, photosynthesis, energy supply, as well as chloroplast protein synthesis, import and processing in various leaf regions at different development stages. Additionally, chloroplast-localized proteoforms involved in nitrogen metabolism, photosynthesis and protein processing implied that post-translational modifications were crucial for leaf color regulation. These results provide new clues toward understanding the mechanisms of leaf color regulation in variegated leaves.

27052743|t|Autologous Cytokine-Induced Killer Cells Improves Overall Survival of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients: Results From a Phase II Clinical Trial.
27052743|a|BACKGROUND: This randomized clinical study was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic benefits of cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cell immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-one patients in group 1 (cell therapy group) received autologous CIK cell immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy (5-Fluorouridine, leucovorin and oxaliplatin [FOLFOX4] plan). Another 61 patients in group 2 (the control group) received chemotherapy (FOLFOX4 plan) alone. The primary study end points were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary end points were treatment response and adverse events. RESULTS: The 3-year PFS and OS in group 1 were 20% and 48%, respectively, compared with 13% and 23%, respectively, in group 2 (P  = .131 and P  < .001, respectively). The median OS in group 1 was significantly increased compared with that in group 2 (OS, 36 vs. 16 months; P  < .001). Furthermore, there was a trend toward superior PFS in group 1 compared with that in group 2 (PFS, 16 vs. 10 months; P  = .072). Using univariate analysis, we found that Karnofsky performance status  <80, number of metastases >1, and increased platelet levels were significantly associated with poorer prognosis in group 1. Alternatively, the cycle count of CIK cell treatment was significantly associated with good prognosis in group 1. Toxicity was mild in patients who received CIK therapy. CONCLUSION: This study shows that CIK cell immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy is well tolerated and improves the OS of mCRC patients.

27049663|t|The Prognostic Utility of a Simplified Biventricular Echocardiographic Index of Cardiac Remodeling in Patients with Pulmonary Hypertension.
27049663|a|BACKGROUND: Right ventricular (RV) remodeling has been associated with outcomes in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH). However, the additive prognostic significance of RV remodeling and left ventricular (LV) morphology in PH is unclear. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the ratio of RV end-diastolic area to LV end-diastolic area is a biventricular index predictive of outcome in patients with PH. METHODS: In total, 139 patients with precapillary PH (mean age, 55      15  years; 75% women) and 22 control subjects (mean age, 40      17  years; 73% women) were studied. The apical four-chamber view was used to measure the RV-to-LV end-diastolic area ratio as an index of biventricular cardiac remodeling. RV free wall and global strain were measured using speckle-tracking echocardiography. The study design was prospective, with all-cause mortality over 5  years predefined as the outcome event. RESULTS: Patients with PH had significantly larger RV to LV end-diastolic area ratios than normal subjects, as expected (1.06 vs 0.67, P  <  .0001). There were 72 deaths over 5  years. Using a cutoff value of 0.93, patients with RV-to-LV ratios  >=   0.93 had significantly higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio,1.84; 95% CI, 1.14-2.96; P  =  .019). RV global strain was also significantly associated with survival using a cutoff of >= -15% (hazard ratio, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.03-2.67; P  =  .044). In a multivariate analysis, only age and biventricular index were independent predictors of survival among other clinical and echocardiographic features. CONCLUSIONS: The RV-to-LV end-diastolic area ratio is a simplified biventricular echocardiographic index of cardiac remodeling that is predictive of long-term survival in patients with PH.

27082228|t|Upregulation of microRNA  -337 promotes the proliferation of endometrial carcinoma cells via targeting PTEN.
27082228|a|UNASSIGNED: Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is a common malignancy in females. MicroRNAs (miRs) are a class of non  -coding RNA that regulate a wide variety of cellular processes, and are important in the development of multiple types of malignancy. In the present study, cancerous and adjacent non  -cancerous normal tissue samples were collected from 24  patients diagnosed with EC. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed on the tissue samples to determine the expression levels of six candidate miRs. These miRs have been previously reported to be differentially expressed in EC; however, the present study observed that only miR  -337 was differentially expressed. In addition, the current study identified phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) as a target of miR  -337 using computational analysis and a luciferase assay. EC cells transfected with miR  -337 mimics and anti  -PTEN small interfering RNA demonstrated significantly decreased expression of PTEN, markedly increased proliferation and inhibition of cell apoptosis. The results indicate that miR  -337 is oncogenic in EC cells, as it suppresses PTEN expression. This may facilitate the development of miR  -based prevention or treatment strategies for EC.

27045727|t|Predictors of Positive Treatment Outcome in People With Anorexia Nervosa Treated in a Specialized Inpatient Unit: The Role of Early Response to Treatment.
27045727|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors which predict positive treatment outcome in inpatients with anorexia nervosa (AN), particularly the role of early treatment response. METHOD: 102 patients entering specialist inpatient treatment were assessed for eating disorder history, psychopathology, and motivation to change. Predictive factors assessed were: early treatment response defined as weight increase of at least 0.5-1   kg/week during the first 6   weeks of treatment (n=87), admission body mass index (BMI), onset age, chronicity, motivation to change, diagnosis, and previous hospitalization for AN. Positive treatment outcome was defined as achieving a BMI of 17.5   kg/m(2) within an individual time frame. RESULTS: Logistic regression indicated that patients were 18 times more likely to reach positive treatment outcome if they met the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence weight guidelines within the first 6   weeks of hospitalization. Higher admission BMI was also found to predict positive treatment outcome. DISCUSSION: Higher entry BMI and early weight gain predict positive treatment outcome in individuals receiving specialist AN inpatient treatment.

27075942|t|Beh  et's disease: A comprehensive review with a focus on epidemiology, etiology and clinical features, and management of mucocutaneous lesions.
27075942|a|UNASSIGNED: Beh  et's disease (BD) is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory multisystem disease of unknown etiology. Oral ulcers, genital ulcers, cutaneous lesions, and ocular and articular involvement are the most frequent features of the disease. Mucocutaneous lesions are considered hallmarks of the disease, and often precede other manifestations. Therefore, their recognition may permit earlier diagnosis and treatment with beneficial results for prognosis. BD is particularly prevalent in "Silk Route" populations but has a global distribution. The disease usually starts around the third or fourth decade of life. Sex distribution is roughly equal. The diagnosis is based on clinical criteria, as there is no pathognomonic test. Genetic factors have been investigated extensively, and association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B51 is still known as the strongest genetic susceptibility factor. The T-helper 17 and interleukin (IL)-17 pathways are active, and play an important role, particularly in acute attacks of BD. Neutrophil activity is increased in BD, and the affected organs show a significant neutrophil and lymphocyte infiltration. HLA-B51 association and increased IL-17 response are thought to play a role in neutrophil activation. Treatment is mainly based on the suppression of inflammatory attacks of the disease using immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive agents. Although treatment has become much more effective in recent years with the introduction of newer drugs, BD is still associated with considerable morbidity and increased mortality. Male sex, younger age of onset and increased number of organs involved at the diagnosis are associated with a more severe disease and, therefore, require more aggressive treatment.

27051425|t|Absence of Flexor Carpi Radialis during an Elective Carpometacarpal Arthroplasty of the Thumb: A Rare Anatomical Variation.
27051425|a|Purpose. We present an extremely rare anatomical variation of unilateral flexor carpi radialis (FCR) absence. This rare anatomical variation posed a clinical dilemma to us and we highlight the importance of the surgeon being aware of this anatomical variation of an important structure both as a reconstruction tool and as an anatomical landmark. Methods. This anatomical variation of the unilaterally absent FCR was found upon dissection during a carpometacarpal arthroplasty of the thumb. Results. Upon the discovery of an absent FCR tendon, we proceeded with a simple trapeziectomy. Conclusions. We present an extremely rare anatomical variation of unilateral FCR absence. This rare anatomical variation may pose clinical dilemmas to the operating surgeon who aims to utilise the FCR either for tendon transfer, for tendon graft, or, as seen in our case, in the reconstruction of a carpometacarpal excision at the thumb. We highlight this diagnosis of suspicion, which may influence the clinical procedure.

27076861|t|Comparison of Alternate and Original Items on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment.
27076861|a|BACKGROUND: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a screening tool for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in elderly individuals. We hypothesized that measurement error when using the new alternate MoCA versions to monitor change over time could be related to the use of items that are not of comparable difficulty to their corresponding originals of similar content. The objective of this study was to compare the difficulty of the alternate MoCA items to the original ones. METHODS: Five selected items from alternate versions of the MoCA were included with items from the original MoCA administered adaptively to geriatric outpatients (N = 78). Rasch analysis was used to estimate the difficulty level of the items. RESULTS: None of the five items from the alternate versions matched the difficulty level of their corresponding original items. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the potential benefits of a Rasch analysis-based approach for selecting items during the process of development of parallel forms. The results suggest that better match of the items from different MoCA forms by their difficulty would result in higher sensitivity to changes in cognitive function over time.

27037022|t|Wound healing delays in a-Klotho-deficient mice that have skin appearance similar to that in aged humans - Study of delayed wound healing mechanism.
27037022|a|UNASSIGNED: Skin atrophy and delayed wound healing are observed in aged humans; however, the molecular mechanism are still elusive. The aim of this study was to analyze the molecular mechanisms of delayed wound healing by aging using a-Klotho-deficient (kl/kl) mice, which have phenotypes similar to those of aged humans. The kl/kl mice showed delayed wound healing and impaired granulation formation compared with those in wild-type (WT) mice. The skin graft experiments revealed that delayed wound healing depends on humoral factors, but not on kl/kl skin tissue. The mRNA expression levels of cytokines related to acute inflammation including IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF-a were higher in wound lesions of kl/kl mice compared with the levels in WT mice by RT-PCR analysis. LPS-induced TNF-a production model using spleen cells revealed that TNF-a production was significantly increased in the presence of FGF23. Thus, higher levels of FGF23 in kl/kl mouse may have a role to increase TNF-a production in would lesion independently of a-Klotho protein, and impair granulation formation and delay wound healing.

27077460|t|Noninnocent Proton-Responsive Ligand Facilitates Reductive Deprotonation and Hinders CO2 Reduction Catalysis in [Ru(tpy)(6DHBP)(NCCH3)](2+) (6DHBP = 6,6'-(OH)2bpy).
27077460|a|UNASSIGNED: Ruthenium complexes with proton-responsive ligands [Ru(tpy)(nDHBP)(NCCH3)](CF3SO3)2 (tpy = 2,2':6',2   -terpyridine; nDHBP = n,n'-dihydroxy-2,2'-bipyridine, n = 4 or 6) were examined for reductive chemistry and as catalysts for CO2 reduction. Electrochemical reduction of [Ru(tpy)(nDHBP)(NCCH3)](2+) generates deprotonated species through interligand electron transfer in which the initially formed tpy radical anion reacts with a proton source to produce singly and doubly deprotonated complexes that are identical to those obtained by base titration. A third reduction (i.e., reduction of [Ru(tpy)(nDHBP-2H(+))](0)) triggers catalysis of CO2 reduction; however, the catalytic efficiency is strikingly lower than that of unsubstituted [Ru(tpy)(bpy)(NCCH3)](2+) (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine). Cyclic voltammetry, bulk electrolysis, and spectroelectrochemical infrared experiments suggest the reactivity of CO2 at both the Ru center and the deprotonated quinone-type ligand. The Ru carbonyl formed by the intermediacy of a metallocarboxylic acid is stable against reduction, and mass spectrometry analysis of this product indicates the presence of two carbonates formed by the reaction of DHBP-2H(+) with CO2.

27041544|t|Epiretinal membrane surgery evaluated by subjective outcome.
27041544|a|PURPOSE: To examine pre- and postoperative visual interference, subjective symptoms and visual acuity in patients undergoing epiretinal membrane (ERM) surgery. METHODS: A retrospective observational case series comparing 239 eyes in 231 consecutive patients with idiopathic ERM in a selected catchment area from 2002 to 2009. Demography, visual acuity (VA), lens status and subjective symptoms were analysed before and after the operation. Patients, healthy enough to participate at least 2  years post surgery, answered a questionnaire about their subjective functional impairment before and after the ERM peeling. Visual disturbance was assessed on a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 1 to 100  mm. RESULTS: The preoperative VA for the eyes in the study was median 0.40 logMAR (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) (range -0.1 to 1.22) resulted in VA of 0.22 logMAR (range -0.1 to 1.1), which is a statistical significant difference (p -). Of 180 patients contacted, answers were received from 103 (57%). Subjective visual disturbance assessed on the VAS showed a median of 70  mm (range 0-100) before surgery compared to a subjective disturbance median 27  mm (range 0-98) postoperatively. The change preoperatively to postoperatively was mean -34  mm (SD 31), median -37 (range -96 to 37), p -. Patients with much disturbance at baseline measured by VAS experienced more subjective benefit of the operation measured by the distance between the mark on the VAS preoperatively and postoperatively, p -, Spearman correlation coefficient. CONCLUSION: Patients with considerable preoperative disturbance benefit more from an operation than those with less disturbance.

27005448|t|Identifying Elder Abuse in the Emergency Department: Toward a Multidisciplinary Team-Based Approach.
27005448|a|

27076213|t|A systematic review of media parenting in the context of childhood obesity research.
27076213|a|BACKGROUND: We conducted a systematic review to obtain studies on childhood obesity and parenting published between 2009 and 2015, and draw out those studies with a particular focus on media parenting. Our analysis addresses two major aims: 1) to describe how media use and media-related parenting practices and skills are operationalized in studies and 2) to explore whether studies measured ecological factors (e.g. individual-, family-, and community-level factors), which could be associated with media parenting practices. METHODS: Using a standardized, multi-stage process, we identified and screened articles focused on parenting and childhood obesity (N   =   667). Studies were eligible for this analysis if they measured media parenting and/or the home media environment, resulting in a sample of 103 studies. We used quantitative content analysis to code the full text articles for content related to our study aims; analyses were performed using SAS 9.4. RESULTS: Seventy nine percent of studies measured media use, 82  % measured media parenting, and 65  % measured the home media environment. Studies measuring media use focused on a limited number of devices; while all studies measured child/parent use of televisions, only 3  % measured use of smartphones, 1  % measured use of laptops, and no studies measured use of tablets. Measures of parenting practices focused largely on rules specific to limiting screen time. Although 60  % of studies measured at least one ecological factor, child-specific and neighborhood/community-level factors were rarely measured. CONCLUSIONS: More detailed measurements of media use that reflects current technology trends and diverse contexts of use are needed to better understand media use and parent regulation of child media exposure. Measures of the ecological context can more fully assess factors impacting media parenting and, subsequently, child risk for overweight and obesity.

27003321|t|Rapid Inpatient Titration of Intravenous Treprostinil for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension: Safe and Tolerable.
27003321|a|UNASSIGNED: There is no standard protocol for intravenous treprostinil dose escalation. In most cases, slow up-titration is performed in the outpatient setting. However, rapid up-titration in an inpatient setting is an alternative that provides opportunity for aggressive treatment of common side effects experienced during dose escalation. In this study, we describe our experience with inpatient rapid up-titration of intravenous treprostinil. This was a single-center, retrospective study in which we reviewed the data of subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension treated at our center who underwent inpatient rapid up-titration of intravenous treprostinil. Our treprostinil dose escalation protocol included initiation at 2 ng  kg  min with subsequent up-titration by 1 ng  kg  min every 6 to 8 hours as tolerated by side effects. A total of 16 subjects were identified. Thirteen subjects were treprostinil naive (naive group), and 3 subjects were receiving subcutaneous treprostinil but were hospitalized for further intravenous up-titration of treprostinil dose (nonnaive group). In the naive group, the median maximum dose achieved was 20 ng  kg  min with an interquartile range (IQR) of 20-23 ng  kg  min. The median up-titration interval was 6 days (IQR: 4-9). In the nonnaive group, the median maximum dose achieved was 20 ng  kg  min (range: 17-30). The median up-titration interval was 8.5 days (range: 1.5-11). Overall, the median maximum dose achieved was 20 ng  kg  min (IQR: 20-23.5), and the median up-titration interval was 6 days (IQR: 4.6-9.25), with no reported significant adverse hemodynamic events. In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, rapid inpatient titration of intravenous treprostinil is safe and tolerable.

27081664|t|Evaluation of model-based deformation correction in image-guided liver surgery via tracked intraoperative ultrasound.
27081664|a|Soft-tissue deformation represents a significant error source in current surgical navigation systems used for open hepatic procedures. While numerous algorithms have been proposed to rectify the tissue deformation that is encountered during open liver surgery, clinical validation of the proposed methods has been limited to surface-based metrics, and subsurface validation has largely been performed via phantom experiments. The proposed method involves the analysis of two deformation-correction algorithms for open hepatic image-guided surgery systems via subsurface targets digitized with tracked intraoperative ultrasound (iUS). Intraoperative surface digitizations were acquired via a laser range scanner and an optically tracked stylus for the purposes of computing the physical-to-image space registration and for use in retrospective deformation-correction algorithms. Upon completion of surface digitization, the organ was interrogated with a tracked iUS transducer where the iUS images and corresponding tracked locations were recorded. Mean closest-point distances between the feature contours delineated in the iUS images and corresponding three-dimensional anatomical model generated from preoperative tomograms were computed to quantify the extent to which the deformation-correction algorithms improved registration accuracy. The results for six patients, including eight anatomical targets, indicate that deformation correction can facilitate reduction in target error of [Formula: see text].

27075114|t|Development of a blocking ELISA for detection of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infection based on a monoclonal antibody against protein P65.
27075114|a|UNASSIGNED: Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae causes porcine enzootic pneumonia, an economically important disease of swine. A more sensitive and reliable method for detection of serum antibodies is needed for epidemiological investigations and to evaluate the effect of immunization. We expressed the M. hyopneumoniae protein P65 in Escherichia coli and produced a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that bound specifically to recombinant P65. Using this mAb, a blocking enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed. The blocking ELISA had similar specificity to and sensitivity with the commercial ELISA produced by IDEXX. Thus, this blocking ELISA is a useful test for serological confirmation of M. hyopneumoniae infection.

27103894|t|Antimalarial and antimicrobial activities of 8-Aminoquinoline-Uracils metal complexes.
27103894|a|8-Aminoquinoline (8AQ) derivatives have been reported to have antimalarial, anticancer, and antioxidant activities. This study investigated the potency of 8AQ-5-substituted (iodo and nitro) uracils metal (Mn, Cu, Ni) complexes (1-6) as antimalarial and antimicrobial agents. Interestingly, all of these metal complexes (1-6) showed fair antimalarial activities. Moreover, Cu complexes 2 (8AQ-Cu-5Iu) and 5 (8AQ-Cu-5Nu) exerted antimicrobial activities against Gram-negative bacteria including P. shigelloides and S. dysenteriae. The results reveal application of 8AQ and its metal complexes as potential compounds to be further developed as novel antimalarial and antibacterial agents.

27055037|t|Social Support and Psychosocial Well-being Among Low-Income, Adolescent, African American, First-Time Mothers.
27055037|a|AIMS: The aims of this study are to describe for single, low-income, adolescent, African American new mothers how (1) primary sources of social support changed over time, (2) the level of social support (emotional, informational, tangible, and problematic) from these primary sources changed over time, and (3) social support from the primary supporter was associated with mothers' psychosocial well-being (self-esteem and loneliness) over time. DESIGN: A secondary analysis was conducted of data from a previous social support intervention study. SAMPLE: The sample consisted of 35 single, low-income, adolescent (mean [SD] age, 18.3 [1.7] years), African American new mothers. METHODS: Mothers completed social support, self-esteem, and loneliness instruments at 1 and 6 weeks and 3 and 6 months postpartum. RESULTS: Most mothers (64.7%) had changes in their primary social support provider during the first 6 months postpartum. The combination of the adolescent's mother and boyfriend provided the highest level of support, no matter the type, relative to any other source of support. At every time point, positive correlations were found between emotional support and self-esteem and between problematic support and loneliness. CONCLUSION: Single, low-income, African American, adolescent new mothers are at risk for not having a consistent source of support, which may lead to lower self-esteem and greater loneliness. IMPLICATIONS: Clinical nurse specialists could facilitate care guidelines for these new mothers to identify their sources of support at each home visit and advocate for the adolescent's mother and boyfriend to work together to provide support. Bolstering the mothers' natural sources of support can potentially improve self-esteem and reduce loneliness. Improvement in these sources of support could prevent a decline in the mothers' psychosocial well-being. Development and testing support interventions are advocated; findings could guide clinical nurse specialists in addressing these new mothers' needs.

27051389|t|Adjuvant Dose-Dense Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer: Standard of Care in High-Risk Patients.
27051389|a|Meta-analyses persistently confirm the superiority of dose-dense chemotherapy in comparison with standard chemotherapy. In contrast, individual studies have shown conflicting results. These may be explained by different risk profiles of the treated patient populations. Some trials show a significant advantage in disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in the estrogen receptor (ER)-negative population only, whereas trials with high-risk populations like GIM-2 (Gruppo Italiano Mammella) and AGO-iddETC (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gyn  kologische Onkologie, intense dose-dense epirubicin, paclitaxel, and cyclophosphamide) show a significant superiority in DFS and OS for both, ER-negative and ER-positive patients even after 7 and 10 years, respectively, of follow-up. In contrast, the 10-year follow-up data of the E1199/Intergroup trial no longer showed any superiority of weekly paclitaxel for ER-positive/HER2-negative patients; superiority was observed in the triple-negative subgroup only. Although a direct head-to-head comparison is missing, iddETC or 4 cycles each of dose-dense epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel are the preferred adjuvant regimens for patients at risk. Patients with >=  4 positive lymph nodes should preferentially be treated with iddETC.

27100483|t|The role of annexin A4 in cancer.
27100483|a|Annexin A4 (ANXA4) is a member of the annexin family that binds to both calcium ions and phospholipids. Studies indicate that ANXA4 modulates membrane permeability and membrane trafficking, participates in cellular growth and apoptosis, enhances tumor invasion and promotes anti-tumor drug resistance. The overexpression of ANXA4 has been identified in various clinical epithelial tumors including: lung, gastric, colorectal, pancreatic, gallbladder, breast, renal, ovarian, laryngeal, and prostate cancers. In addition, upregulation and nuclear translocation of ANXA4 have been observed in the progression of colorectal cancer and ovarian serous carcinoma. Knockdown of ANXA4 attenuated migration in ovarian cancer and breast cancer cells. In contrast, knockdown of ANXA4 increased susceptibility to platinum in ovarian cancer and malignant mesothelioma cells. It is conceivable that ANXA4 is an indicator for tumor development, invasion, chemo-resistance, poor outcomes of cancer patients, and may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

27006343|t|'Why should I worry, since I have healthy feet?' A qualitative study exploring barriers to use of footwear among rural community members in northern Ethiopia.
27006343|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of personal, cultural and socioeconomic factors related to footwear use and non-use in northern Ethiopia. DESIGN: A qualitative study was conducted using focus group discussions and in-depth individual interviews. Data were collected using semistructured interview guides. SETTING: The study was conducted in East and West Gojjam Zones, Amhara region, northwest Ethiopia. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 91 individuals from 4 target groups participated in individual and group interviews: (1) non-affected community leaders including Idir (a form of social insurance) leaders, school principals, kebele (the lowest administrative unit) officials, health professionals, teachers, merchants and religious leaders; (2) affected men and women; (3) non-affected men and women not in leadership positions; and (4) school children (both male and female). RESULTS: Participants perceived a range of health benefits from donning footwear, including protection against injury and cold. Various types of shoes are available within the community, and their use varied depending on the nature of activities and the season. Personal and socioeconomic barriers hindered the desire to consistently use footwear. Widely established barefoot traditions and beliefs that footwear is uncomfortable, heavy and may weaken the feet have made the regular use of footwear uncommon. Economic constraints were also mentioned as hindering ownership and use of footwear. Distance from places where shoes could be bought also contributed to limited access. Cultural influences promoting gender inequality resulted in women being least able to access shoes. CONCLUSIONS: We identified several individual, cultural and socioeconomic barriers that influence individuals' decisions about and use of footwear in rural northern Ethiopia. Promoting education on the health benefits of footwear, curbing podoconiosis-related misconceptions and integrating these with economic empowerment programmes, may all improve the use of footwear.

27096629|t|Urinary levels of bisphenol A, benzophenones and parabens in Tunisian women: A pilot study.
27096629|a|UNASSIGNED: Bisphenol A (BPA), benzophenones and parabens are commonly used in the production of polycarbonate plastics, as UV-filters and as antimicrobial preservatives, respectively, and they are thought to exhibit endocrine disrupting properties. Exposure to these compounds remains poorly characterized in developing countries, despite the fact that certain behaviors related to westernization have the potential to influence exposure. The aim of this pilot study was to measure urinary concentrations of BPA, six different benzophenones and four parabens in 34 Tunisian women. In addition, we identified some socio-demographic and dietary predictors of exposure to these compounds. Chemical analyses were carried out by dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (UHPLC-MS/MS). Detection frequencies of methylparaben (MP), ethylparaben (EP) and propylparaben (PP) ranged between 67.6 and 94.1%. Butylparaben (BP) was found in 38.2% of the analyzed samples; BPA in 64.7%; and benzophenone-1 (BP-1) and benzophenone-3 (BP-3) were detected in 91.2 and 64.7% of the analyzed samples, respectively. Urinary geometric mean concentrations of MP, EP, PP, and BP were 30.1, 1.4, 2.0 and 0.5ngmL(-1), respectively. Geometric mean concentrations of BPA, BP-1, and BP-3 were 0.4, 1.3 and 1.1ngmL(-1), respectively. Our results suggest that Tunisian women are widely exposed to BPA, parabens and some benzophenones. Further studies on the general Tunisian population are needed in order to assess the levels of exposure to these compounds and to identify sources of exposure and population groups at higher risk.

27042950|t|Interhospital transfer handoff practices among US tertiary care centers: A descriptive survey.
27042950|a|BACKGROUND: Interhospital transfer is an understudied area within transitions of care. The process by which hospitals accept and transfer patients is not well described. National trends and best practices are unclear. OBJECTIVE: To describe the demographics of large transfer centers, to identify common handoff practices, and to describe challenges and notable innovations involving the interhospital transfer handoff process. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of 32 tertiary care centers in the United States was studied. Respondents were typically transfer center directors surveyed by phone. MAIN MEASURES: Data regarding transfer center demographics, handoff communication practices, electronic infrastructure, and data sharing were obtained. RESULTS: The median number of patients transferred each month per receiving institution was 700 (range, 250-2500); on average, 28% of these patients were transferred to an intensive care unit. Transfer protocols and practices varied by institution. Transfer center coordinators typically had a medical background (78%), and critical care-trained registered nurse was the most prevalent (38%). Common practices included: mandatory recorded 3-way physician-to-physician conversation (84%) and mandatory clinical status updates prior to patient arrival (81%). However, the timeline of clinical status updates was variable. Less frequent transfer practices included: electronic medical record (EMR) cross-talk availability and utilization (23%), real-time transfer center documentation accessibility in the EMR (32%), and referring center clinical documentation available prior to transport (29%). A number of innovative strategies to address challenges involving interhospital handoffs are reported. CONCLUSIONS: Interhospital transfer practices vary widely amongst tertiary care centers. Practices that lead to improved patient handoffs and reduced medical errors need additional prospective evaluation. Journal of Hospital Medicine 2016.    2016 Society of Hospital Medicine.

27111023|t|Ex vivo evaluation of the effect of various surgical procedures on blood delivery to the patellar tendon of dogs.
27111023|a|OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of arthrotomy alone or in combination with osteotomy of the proximal portion of the tibia on blood delivery to the patellar tendon of dogs. SAMPLE 24 canine cadavers. PROCEDURES One hind limb from each cadaver was assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups: medial arthrotomy (MA; MA group), lateral arthrotomy (LA; LA group), MA and LA with tibial tuberosity transposition (MALA group), and MA with tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO; TPLO group). The contralateral hind limb served as the control sample. Contrast solution (barium [33%], India ink [17%], and saline [0.9% NaCl] solution [50%]) was injected through an 8F catheter inserted in the caudal portion of the abdominal aorta. Limbs were radiographed to allow examination of vascular filling. The patella, patellar tendon, and tibial crest were harvested, radiographed to allow examination of tissue vascular filling, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Vessels perfused with contrast solution were counted in sections obtained from the proximal, middle, and distal regions of each patellar tendon. RESULTS Vessel counts did not differ significantly among the 3 tendon regions. Compared with results for the control group, delivery of contrast solution to the patellar tendon was significantly decreased in the MALA and TPLO groups but was not changed in the MA or LA groups. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results indicated that surgical procedures used to treat cranial cruciate injuries (ie, TPLO) and patellar luxation decreased blood delivery to the patellar tendon of canine cadavers, at least acutely.

27111011|t|Biomechanical evaluation of two plating configurations for critical-sized defects of the mandible in dogs.
27111011|a|OBJECTIVE To compare the biomechanical behavior of mandibular critical-sized defects stabilized with 2 plating configurations under in vitro conditions resembling clinical situations. SAMPLE 24 mandibles harvested from 12 adult canine cadavers. PROCEDURES 8 mandibles were kept intact as control samples. A critical-sized defect was created in 16 mandibles; these mandibles were stabilized by use of a single locking plate (LP [n = 8]) or an LP combined with an alveolar miniplate (LMP [8]). Mandibles were loaded in cantilever bending in a single-load-to-failure test with simultaneous recording of load and actuator displacement. Stiffness, yield, and failure properties were compared among groups. Mode of failure was recorded. Radiographic evidence of tooth root and mandibular canal damage was quantified and compared between groups. RESULTS Stiffness and yield loads of single LP and LMP constructs were < 30% of values for intact mandibles, and failure loads were < 45% of values for intact mandibles. There were no consistent biomechanical differences at failure between single LP and LMP constructs, but the LMP construct had greater stiffness and strength prior to yield. Frequency of screw penetration of teeth and the mandibular canal was significantly greater for LMP than for single LP constructs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Both fixation methods were mechanically inferior to an intact mandible. The LMP construct was mechanically stronger than the LP construct but may not be clinically justifiable. Addition of an alveolar miniplate provided additional strength to the construct but resulted in more frequent penetration of tooth roots and the mandibular canal.

27111004|t|The Effectiveness of a 3D Computerized Tutorial to Enhance Learning of the Canine Larynx and Hyoid Apparatus.
27111004|a|UNASSIGNED: Teaching the anatomy of the canine larynx and hyoid apparatus is challenging because dissection disassembles and/or damages these structures, making it difficult to understand their three-dimensional anatomy and spatial interrelationships. This study assessed the effectiveness of an interactive computerized 3D tutorial for teaching the anatomy of the canine larynx and hyoid apparatus using a randomized control design with students enrolled in the first-year professional program at Oregon State University College of Veterinary Medicine. All first-year students from 2 consecutive years were eligible. All students received the traditional methods of didactic teaching and dissection to learn the anatomy of the canine larynx and hyoid apparatus, after which they were divided into two statistically equal groups based on their cumulative anatomy test scores from the prior term. The tutorial group received an interactive computerized tutorial developed by the investigators containing 3D images of the canine larynx and hyoid apparatus, while the control group received the same 3D images without the computerized tutorial. Both groups received the same post-learning assessment and survey. Sixty-three first-year students participated in the study, 28 in the tutorial group and 35 in the control group. Post-learning assessment and survey scores were both significantly higher among students in the computerized tutorial group than those in the control group. This study demonstrates that a 3D computerized tutorial is more effective in teaching the anatomy of the canine hyoid apparatus and larynx than 3D images without a tutorial. Students likewise rated their learning experience higher when using the 3D computerized tutorial.

27009807|t|The Disease Portals, disease-gene annotation and the RGD disease ontology at the Rat Genome Database.
27009807|a|The Rat Genome Database (RGD;http://rgd.mcw.edu/) provides critical datasets and software tools to a diverse community of rat and non-rat researchers worldwide. To meet the needs of the many users whose research is disease oriented, RGD has created a series of Disease Portals and has prioritized its curation efforts on the datasets important to understanding the mechanisms of various diseases. Gene-disease relationships for three species, rat, human and mouse, are annotated to capture biomarkers, genetic associations, molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets. To generate gene-disease annotations more effectively and in greater detail, RGD initially adopted the MEDIC disease vocabulary from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database and adapted it for use by expanding this framework with the addition of over 1000 terms to create the RGD Disease Ontology (RDO). The RDO provides the foundation for, at present, 10 comprehensive disease area-related dataset and analysis platforms at RGD, the Disease Portals. Two major disease areas are the focus of data acquisition and curation efforts each year, leading to the release of the related Disease Portals. Collaborative efforts to realize a more robust disease ontology are underway.Database URL:http://rgd.mcw.edu.

27015741|t|The ambiguous nature of epigenetic responsibility.
27015741|a|UNASSIGNED: Over the past decade, epigenetic studies have been providing further evidence of the molecular interplay between gene expression and its health outcomes on one hand, and the physical and social environments in which individuals are conceived, born and live on the other. As knowledge of epigenetic programming expands, a growing body of literature in social sciences and humanities is exploring the implications of this new field of study for contemporary societies. Epigenetics has been mobilised to support political claims, for instance, with regard to collective obligations to address socio-environmental determinants of health. The idea of a moral 'epigenetic responsibility' has been proposed, meaning that individuals and/or governments should be accountable for the epigenetic programming of children and/or citizens. However, these discussions have largely overlooked important biological nuances and ambiguities inherent in the field of epigenetics. In this paper, we argue that the identification and assignment of moral epigenetic responsibilities should reflect the rich diversity and complexity of epigenetic mechanisms, and not rely solely on a gross comparison between epigenetics and genetics. More specifically, we explore how further investigation of the ambiguous notions ofepigenetic normalityandepigenetic plasticityshould play a role in shaping this emerging debate.

27005396|t|Community engagement practices in Southern Africa: Review and thematic synthesis of studies done in Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa.
27005396|a|UNASSIGNED: Community Engagement (CE) is intended to enhance the participation of community stakeholders in research. CE is usually mentioned in publications as researchers discuss how they carried out community entry, consent and retained study participants but the actual CE activities are not always well documented. This paper reviews CE strategies employed in health research in Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe with reference to the development of a CE strategy for a multi-centre study to be conducted in these countries. The search was conducted using JANE (Journal/Author Name Estimator), Google Scholar and PubMed with known institutions and researchers providing context-specific material. The final synthesis includes 35 publications, 2 reports and 2 abstracts. There is evidence of CE being practiced in health research and eight closely related CE strategies were revealed. We conclude that since communities are heterogeneous and unique, CE activities will not have similar results in different settings. Even though there was insufficient evidence to determine which CE strategy is most effective, the review provides sufficient information to develop a CE strategy for a multi-centre study using the various strategies and activities described.

A 4 yr-old male patient presented with ascending weakness, dysarthria and dysphagia to   stanbul Dr. L  tfi K  rdar Kartal Training and Research Hospital Neurology outpatient for three days to in 2012. Dysphonia, restricted eye movements, flaccid tetraplegia and areflexia were found in neurological examination. There were motor conduction blocks in all peripheral nerves in electrophysiological studies.According to these findings the patient was diagnosed as Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP). Reduction of CMAP amplitudes in posterior tibial nerve, absence of CMAPs in median, ulnar and peroneal nerves and loss of motor conduction blocks were found in following electrophysiological studies. According to these findings, patient was diagnosed as AMAN. Motor conduction blocks may appear in early stage of AMAN and they disappear in later examinations. That's why electrophysiological studies must be repeated in patients with GBS.

27065477|t|A Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count Analysis of the Adult Attachment Interview in Two Large Corpora.
27065477|a|UNASSIGNED: An emerging literature suggests that variation in Adult Attachment Interview (AAI; George, Kaplan, _ Main, 1985) states of mind about childhood experiences with primary caregivers is reflected in specific linguistic features captured by the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count automated text analysis program (LIWC; Pennebaker, Booth, _ Francis, 2007). The current report addressed limitations of prior studies in this literature by using two large AAI corpora (Ns = 826 and 857) and a broader range of linguistic variables, as well as examining associations of LIWC-derived AAI dimensions with key developmental antecedents. First, regression analyses revealed that dismissing states of mind were associated with transcripts that were more truncated and deemphasized discussion of the attachment relationship whereas preoccupied states of mind were associated with longer, more conflicted, and angry narratives. Second, in aggregate, LIWC variables accounted for over a third of the variation in AAI dismissing and preoccupied states of mind, with regression weights cross-validating across samples. Third, LIWC-derived dismissing and preoccupied state of mind dimensions were associated with direct observations of maternal and paternal sensitivity as well as infant attachment security in childhood, replicating the pattern of results reported in Haydon, Roisman, Owen, Booth-LaForce, and Cox (2014) using coder-derived dismissing and preoccupation scores in the same sample.

27087935|t|18S rRNA V9 metabarcoding for diet characterization: a critical evaluation with two sympatric zooplanktivorous fish species.
27087935|a|The potential of the 18S rRNA V9 metabarcoding approach for diet assessment was explored using MiSeq paired-end (PE; 2  *  150  bp) technology. To critically evaluate the method's performance with degraded/digested DNA, the diets of two zooplanktivorous fish species from the Bay of Biscay, European sardine (Sardina pilchardus) and European sprat (Sprattus sprattus), were analysed. The taxonomic resolution and quantitative potential of the 18S V9 metabarcoding was first assessed both in silico and with mock and field plankton samples. Our method was capable of discriminating species within the reference database in a reliable way providing there was at least one variable position in the 18S V9 region. Furthermore, it successfully discriminated diet between both fish species, including habitat and diel differences among sardines, overcoming some of the limitations of traditional visual-based diet analysis methods. The high sensitivity and semi-quantitative nature of the 18S V9 metabarcoding approach was supported by both visual microscopy and qPCR-based results. This molecular approach provides an alternative cost and time effective tool for food-web analysis.

27012785|t|A novel comparative pattern analysis approach identifies chronic alcohol mediated dysregulation of transcriptomic dynamics during liver regeneration.
27012785|a|BACKGROUND: Liver regeneration is inhibited by chronic ethanol consumption and this impaired repair response may contribute to the risk for alcoholic liver disease. We developed and applied a novel data analysis approach to assess the effect of chronic ethanol intake in the mechanisms responsible for liver regeneration. We performed a time series transcriptomic profiling study of the regeneration response after 2/3(rd) partial hepatectomy (PHx) in ethanol-fed and isocaloric control rats. RESULTS: We developed a novel data analysis approach focusing on comparative pattern counts (COMPACT) to exhaustively identify the dominant and subtle differential expression patterns. Approximately 6500 genes were differentially regulated in Ethanol or Control groups within 24  h after PHx. Adaptation to chronic ethanol intake significantly altered the immediate early gene expression patterns and nearly completely abrogated the cell cycle induction in hepatocytes post PHx. The patterns highlighted by COMPACT analysis contained several non-parenchymal cell specific markers indicating their aberrant transcriptional response as a novel mechanism through which chronic ethanol intake deregulates the integrated liver tissue response. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel comparative pattern analysis revealed new insights into ethanol-mediated molecular changes in non-parenchymal liver cells as a possible contribution to the defective liver regeneration phenotype. The results revealed for the first time an ethanol-induced shift of hepatic stellate cells from a pro-regenerative phenotype to that of an anti-regenerative state after PHx. Our results can form the basis for novel interventions targeting the non-parenchymal cells in normalizing the dysfunctional repair response process in alcoholic liver disease. Our approach is illustrated online at http://compact.jefferson.edu .

27013256|t|Is there a correlation between aberrant embryonic crown-rump length growth velocities and subsequent birth weights?
27013256|a|UNASSIGNED: In this study, we tested the hypothesis that anomalous first trimester growth affects birth weight. Four hundred and fifteen women with viable singleton pregnancies at the primary transvaginal scan who had at least two crown rump length (CRL) and birth weight data were included. A linear mixed model was fitted to the Box-Cox transformed CRL values to evaluate the association between the GA and the embryonic growth. For multivariate analysis we included maternal age, height, weight, parity, number of miscarriages, vaginal bleeding, smoking, foetal gender, birth weight, small-for-gestation (SGA) and large-for gestation (LGA) categories at delivery. Smoking appeared to be significant for predicting the initial CRL from the beginning of the pregnancy (p value   =   0.013). The SGA foetuses appeared to have slightly slower embryonic growth rates compared to non-SGA (p value   =   0.045), after taking into account the effect of smoking on the initial CRL. None of the other variables including subsequent birth weight or LGA category have statistically significant effect on the first trimester embryonic growth curve when tested separately.

27012625|t|Milk sphingomyelin improves lipid metabolism and alters gut microbiota in high fat diet-fed mice.
27012625|a|High dietary fat intake can cause elevated serum and hepatic lipids, as well as contribute to gut dysbiosis, intestinal barrier dysfunction and increased circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Dietary milk sphingomyelin (SM) has been shown to inhibit lipid absorption in rodents. We evaluated the effects of milk SM on lipid metabolism and LPS levels in C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet for 4weeks and compared it with egg SM. Mice were fed a high-fat diet (45%kcal from fat) (CTL, n=10) or the same diet modified to contain 0.25% (wt/wt) milk SM (MSM, n=10) or 0.25% (wt/wt) egg SM (ESM, n=10). After 4weeks, MSM had gained significantly less weight and had reduced serum cholesterol compared to CTL. ESM had increases in serum cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids and SM compared to CTL. MSM significantly decreased, while ESM increased, hepatic triglycerides. This may have been related to induction of hepatic stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 mRNA observed in ESM. MSM displayed intestinal and hepatic gene expression changes consistent with cholesterol depletion. MSM had significantly lower serum LPS compared to CTL, which may have been due to altered distal gut microbiota. Fecal Gram-negative bacteria were significantly lower, while fecal Bifidobacterium were higher, in MSM. These results suggest that milk SM is more effective than egg SM at combating the detrimental effects of a high-fat diet in mice. Additionally, distal gut microbiota is altered with milk SM and this may have contributed to the lower serum LPS observed.

27015005|t|Consortia of low-abundance bacteria drive sulfate reduction-dependent degradation of fermentation products in peat soil microcosms.
27015005|a|UNASSIGNED: Dissimilatory sulfate reduction in peatlands is sustained by a cryptic sulfur cycle and effectively competes with methanogenic degradation pathways. In a series of peat soil microcosms incubated over 50 days, we identified bacterial consortia that responded to small, periodic additions of individual fermentation products (formate, acetate, propionate, lactate or butyrate) in the presence or absence of sulfate. Under sulfate supplementation, net sulfate turnover (ST) steadily increased to 16-174   nmol   cm(-3) per day and almost completely blocked methanogenesis. 16S rRNA gene and cDNA amplicon sequencing identified microorganisms whose increases in ribosome numbers strongly correlated to ST. Natively abundant (   0.1% estimated genome abundance) species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) showed no significant response to sulfate. In contrast, low-abundance OTUs responded significantly to sulfate in incubations with propionate, lactate and butyrate. These OTUs included members of recognized sulfate-reducing taxa (Desulfosporosinus, Desulfopila, Desulfomonile, Desulfovibrio) and also members of taxa that are either yet unknown sulfate reducers or metabolic interaction partners thereof. Most responsive OTUs markedly increased their ribosome content but only weakly increased in abundance. Responsive Desulfosporosinus OTUs even maintained a constantly low population size throughout 50 days, which suggests a novel strategy of rare biosphere members to display activity. Interestingly, two OTUs of the non-sulfate-reducing genus Telmatospirillum (Alphaproteobacteria) showed strongly contrasting preferences towards sulfate in butyrate-amended microcosms, corroborating that closely related microorganisms are not necessarily ecologically coherent. We show that diverse consortia of low-abundance microorganisms can perform peat soil sulfate reduction, a process that exerts control on methane production in these climate-relevant ecosystems.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 25 March 2016; doi:10.1038/ismej.2016.42.

27069649|t|Effects of multiple vein microjoints on the mechanical behaviour of dragonfly wings: numerical modelling.
27069649|a|Dragonfly wings are known as biological composites with high morphological complexity. They mainly consist of a network of rigid veins and flexible membranes, and enable insects to perform various flight manoeuvres. Although several studies have been done on the aerodynamic performance of Odonata wings and the mechanisms involved in their deformations, little is known about the influence of vein joints on the passive deformability of the wings in flight. In this article, we present the first three-dimensional finite-element models of five different vein joint combinations observed in Odonata wings. The results from the analysis of the models subjected to uniform pressures on their dorsal and ventral surfaces indicate the influence of spike-associated vein joints on the dorsoventral asymmetry of wing deformation. Our study also supports the idea that a single vein joint may result in different angular deformations when it is surrounded by different joint types. The developed numerical models also enabled us to simulate the camber formation and stress distribution in the models. The computational data further provide deeper insights into the functional role of resilin patches and spikes in vein joint structures. This study might help to more realistically model the complex structure of insect wings in order to design more efficient bioinspired micro-air vehicles in future.

27003801|t|Endoscopic antralplasty for severe gastric stasis after wide endoscopic submucosal dissection in the antrum.
27003801|a|UNASSIGNED: A 75-year-old female underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, revealing a widely spreading tumor occupying the anterior wall, lesser curvature, and posterior wall of the antrum and lower body. Endoscopic submucosal dissection was performed and resulted in more than five-sixths circumferential antral mucosal resection. One month later, she complained of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distention. Endoscopy showed residual food in the stomach and deformation of the antrum with traction toward the contracted scar in the lesser curvature. The pyloric ring could not be seen from the antrum although the endoscope was able to pass easily beyond the area of deformation and the pyloric ring was intact. Despite repeated endoscopic balloon dilations, the patient's symptoms remained refractory. The problem was speculated to be not due to any potential stricture but to antrum deformation resulting from the traction force toward the healing ulcer. We hypothesized that an additional countertraction force opposite the previous ESD site might resolve the problem, and ESD of approximately 2.5  cm size was performed in the greater curvature of the antrum. Along with development of a scar, traction toward the greater curvature was added, and the pyloric ring could be observed  on repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy. The symptoms were also gradually ameliorated. Afterwards, the endoscopic findings have now been unchanged during 7  years of follow-up.

27076848|t|Sex Difference of Egfr Expression and Molecular Pathway in the Liver: Impact on Drug Design and Cancer Treatments?
27076848|a|Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been used as the target in drug design for cancer treatment including the liver cancer. Men and women have different levels of EGFR expression during the life. The whole genome expression profiles of livers of recombinant inbred (RI) strains derived from C57BL/6J (B6) X DBA/2J (D2) were used to compare three major molecular aspects of Egfr gene: the relative expression levels, gene network and eQTLs that regulate the expression of Egfr between female and male mice. Our data suggest that there is a significant difference in the expression levels in the liver between female and male mice. Several important genes in the gene network of Egfr are differentially expressed between female and male mice. The regulatory elements for the expression levels of Egfr between female and male mice are also different. In summary, our data reveals an important sex difference in the Egfr pathways in the liver of the mice. These data may have substantial impact on drug development and dosage determinant for women and men in the clinical trials.

27008682|t|The Reorganization of Human Brain Networks Modulated by Driving Mental Fatigue.
27008682|a|UNASSIGNED: The organization of the brain functional network is associated with mental fatigue, but little is known about the brain network topology that is modulated by the mental fatigue. In this study, we used the graph theory approach to investigate reconfiguration changes in functional networks of different electroencephalography (EEG) bands from 16 subjects performing a simulated driving task. Behavior and brain functional networks were compared between the normal and driving mental fatigue states. The scores of subjective self-reports indicated that 90 mins of simulated driving induced mental fatigue. We observed that coherence was significantly increased in the frontal, central and temporal brain regions. Furthermore, in the brain network topology metric, significant increases were observed in the clustering coefficient (Cp) for beta, alpha and delta bands and the character path length (Lp) for all EEG bands. The normalized measures showed significant increases in beta, alpha and delta bands, and showed similar patterns in beta and theta bands. These results indicate that functional network topology can shift the network topology structure towards a more economic but less efficient configuration, which suggests low wiring costs in functional networks and disruption of the effective interactions between and across cortical regions during mental fatigue states. Graph theory analysis might be a useful tool for further understanding the neural mechanisms of driving mental fatigue.

27002326|a|UNASSIGNED: Tissue development requires the expression of a regulated subset of genes, and it is becoming clear that the process of alternative splicing also plays an important role in the production of necessary tissue-specific isoforms. However, only a few of these tissue-specific splicing factors in mammals have so far been discovered. One of these factors is the RNA-binding protein RBM24 which has been recently identified as a major regulator of alternative splicing in cardiac and skeletal muscle development. The RBM24 protein contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain that presumably mediates the binding to target pre-mRNA required for regulation of the splicing patterns. Here we report (1)H, (15)N and (13)C chemical shift assignments of the backbone and sidechain atoms for the RRM domain from human RBM24. Secondary chemical shift analysis and relaxation measurement confirm the canonical architecture of the RRM domain. The data will allow for atomic level studies aimed at understanding splicing regulation of target genes in heart and muscle development and investigation into a separate role of RBM24 in modulating mRNA stability of genes involved in the p53 tumor suppressor pathway.

27099330|t|I.V. ascorbic acid for treatment of apparent rasburicase-induced methemoglobinemia in a patient with acute kidney injury and assumed glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.
27099330|a|PURPOSE: A case of apparent rasburicase-induced methemoglobinemia and acute kidney injury treated with i.v. ascorbic acid because of suspected glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is reported. SUMMARY: A 46-year-old African-American man with a recent diagnosis of multiple myeloma and renal insufficiency was admitted to the hospital with a cough, hemoptysis, and fatigue. His medical history included hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ventricular tachycardia, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and pleural effusion. No treatments for multiple myeloma were started before hospital admission. Levofloxacin 750 mg orally daily for possible pneumonia, lenalidomide 10 mg orally daily, and dexamethasone 20 mg orally weekly were administered. Plasmapheresis was also initiated. Laboratory test results revealed sustained hyperuricemia, which was believed to be due in part to tumor lysis, and a single dose of rasburicase 6 mg i.v. was administered. Subsequently, the patient experienced a decrease in oxygen saturation. Methemoglobinemia was suspected, and the patient's methemoglobin fraction was found to be 14.5%. The patient developed worsening shortness of breath and a drop in hemoglobin concentration, consistent with methemoglobinemia and hemolysis. Ascorbic acid 5 g i.v. every 6 hours was initiated for a total of six doses. Because the patient was assumed to have G6PD deficiency, which was later confirmed, methylene blue was avoided. Within 24 hours, the patient's oxygen saturation values and symptoms improved. CONCLUSION: A patient with apparent rasburicase-induced methemoglobinemia and acute kidney injury was treated with i.v. ascorbic acid (5 g every six hours for six doses) because of the possibility, later proved, that he had G6PD deficiency. The methemoglobinemia resolved without worsening of renal function.

27104711|t|Competing Turing and Faraday Instabilities in Longitudinally Modulated Passive Resonators.
27104711|a|UNASSIGNED: We experimentally investigate the interplay of Turing (modulational) and Faraday (parametric) instabilities in a bistable passive nonlinear resonator. The Faraday branch is induced via parametric resonance owing to a periodic modulation of the resonator dispersion. We show that the bistable switching dynamics is dramatically affected by the competition between the two instability mechanisms, which dictates two completely novel scenarios. At low detunings from resonance, switching occurs between the stable stationary lower branch and the Faraday-unstable upper branch, whereas at high detunings we observe the crossover between the Turing and Faraday periodic structures. The results are well explained in terms of the universal Lugiato-Lefever model.

27019312|t|Case Report: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia with liver herniation into the pericardium in a 30-week gestation infant.
27019312|a|UNASSIGNED: Anterior diaphragmatic defects with pericardial involvement are extremely rare and diagnostically challenging entities encountered perinatally. While a majority of diaphragmatic defects occur in isolation, others are associated with multiple defects forming a complex of syndromes such as Pentalogy of Cantrell. Liver herniation into the pericardial sac poses a particular challenge and can mimic a pericardial tumor on prenatal ultrasound, yielding a different management course. The following case is an unusual presentation of a 30 week gestation female with an anterior diaphragmatic defect with liver herniation mimicking as a pericardial tumor, diagnosed at time of autopsy. Postmortem studies also found multiple congenital anomalies including an atrioventricular defect and midline gumline defect suggesting at least a partial Pentalogy of Cantrell or variant. Early recognition and screening for associated anomalies are essential for management in this subset of patients.

27103980|a|In hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), frequent episodes of nasal and gastrointestinal bleeding commonly lead to iron-deficiency with or without anemia. In the retrospective study presented here we assessed the iron stores, as determined by analysis of plasma ferritin, during oral and intravenous iron supplementation, respectively, in a population of iron-deficient non-anemic HHT patients who were inadequately iron-repleted by oral supplementation. A switch from oral to intravenous iron supplementation was associated with a significant increase in ferritin in this patient population.

27006413|t|Incidence of Breakthrough Urinary Tract Infection in Hospitalized Infants Receiving Antibiotic Prophylaxis.
27006413|a|UNASSIGNED: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a source of substantial morbidity in children in the neonatal intensive care unit. The incidence of UTIs that occur in critically ill infants during a course of antibiotic prophylaxis (i.e., breakthrough urinary tract infections [BUTIs]) is not known. We investigated the incidence of BUTI in a cohort of infants hospitalized on prophylactic antibiotics in neonatal intensive care units. Predictors of BUTI were evaluated using multivariable Cox regression. Out of 716   787 infants, 631 (0.09%) were prescribed 821 courses of antibiotic prophylaxis. Among this cohort, 60 infants (9.5%) suffered a total of 65 BUTIs. Of all prophylactic antibiotic courses, 65/821 (7.9%) were complicated by BUTI.Klebsiella, Enterobacter, andEscherichia colispecies were the most common causes of BUTI. There was no statistically significant difference (P= .78) in BUTI incidence among the 4 antibiotics assessed (amoxicillin, cephalexin, nitrofurantoin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole).

27000083|t|Morning cortisol levels and glucose metabolism parameters in moderate and severe obstructive sleep apnea patients.
27000083|a|UNASSIGNED: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been associated with dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and alterations in glucose metabolism with increased risk for type 2 diabetes. The aim of the current study was to compare morning plasma cortisol levels and glucose metabolism parameters between moderate (apnea-hypopnea index (AHI): 15-30  events/h) and severe OSA patients (AHI >30  events/h), with respective controls. A total of 56 male OSA patients, 24 moderate (AHI  =  21.1      5.3) and 32 severe (AHI  =  49.7      18.1), underwent a full-night polysomnography, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and measurement of morning plasma cortisol levels. These groups were compared to 20 matched subjects in a control group. Morning plasma cortisol levels were statistically lower in severe OSA group than in moderate OSA and control groups (303.7      93.5 vs. 423.9      145.1 vs. 417.5      99.8  pmol/L, P  <  0.001). Significant negative correlations were found between morning plasma cortisol levels and AHI (r  =  -0.444, P  =  0.002), as well as oxygen desaturation index (r  =  -0.381, P  =  0.011). Fasting plasma glucose (5.0      0.5 vs. 5.4      0.7 vs. 4.9      0.6  mmol/L, P  =  0.009) was higher in the severe OSA group compared to moderate OSA and controls. Homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was higher in the severe OSA group compared to moderate OSA and controls (4.6      3.7 vs. 2.7      2.0 and 2.2      1.8, respectively, P  =  0.006). In conclusion, our study showed that morning plasma cortisol levels measured at 8  a.m. were significantly lower in severe OSA patients than those in moderate OSA group and controls. Morning plasma cortisol levels showed a negative correlation with AHI and oxygen desaturation index. Additionally, this study confirmed the evidence of glucose metabolism impairment in moderate and severe OSA patients, with more pronounced effect in the severe OSA patients group.

27006046|t|Graduating nurses' self-efficacy in palliative care practice: An exploratory study.
27006046|a|BACKGROUND: Educational institutions and the health care industry agree that graduates from professional programs need to be "work ready" and capable of delivering competent and confident nursing care. One measure of program success is the student's self-efficacy in meeting expected graduate capabilities. In this study student's self-efficacy is related to palliative care graduate capabilities. AIM: To explore graduating Bachelor of Nursing Science (BNSc) students' self-efficacy in caring for palliative care patients. DESIGN: A qualitative design using semi-structured face-to-face interviews. SETTING: A regional Australian university. PARTICIPANTS: A purposive sample of 10 students in their final semester of study in a Bachelor of Nursing Science degree program. METHOD: Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted. Interview questions were informed by published palliative care graduate capabilities. Interview data were transcribed verbatim and coded by capability. The coded data were then analysed to determine evidence of self-efficacy in caring for palliative care patients. RESULTS: All participants had experiences in caring for palliative care patients. However, the responses did not consistently reflect high degrees of self-efficacy in four documented palliative care graduate capabilities required to care for persons with a life-limiting illness. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support others that have identified gaps between curriculum and health care industry requirements in terms of students' beliefs about their empowerment to deliver nursing care as graduates. Education interventions and approaches to program evaluation require further development to better support students' growth of self-efficacy in undertaking their graduate roles.

27114104|t|Effectiveness of comprehensive care programs for patients with multiple chronic conditions or frailty: A systematic literature review.
27114104|a|OBJECTIVE: To describe comprehensive care programs targeting multimorbid and/or frail patients and to estimate their effectiveness regarding improvement of patient and caregiver related outcomes, healthcare utilization and costs. METHODS: Systematic search in six electronic databases for scientific papers published between January 2011 and March 2014, supplemented by reference tracking. Wagner's Chronic Care Model (CCM) was used to operationalize comprehensive care. The quality of the included studies was assessed, and a best-evidence synthesis was applied. RESULTS: Nineteen publications were included describing effects of eighteen comprehensive care programs for multimorbid or frail patients, of which only one was implemented in a European country. Programs varied in target groups, settings, interventions and number of CCM components addressed. Providing comprehensive care might result in more patient satisfaction, less depressive symptoms, a better health-related quality of life or functioning of multimorbid or frail patients, but the evidence is insufficient. There is no evidence that comprehensive care reduces the number of primary care or GP visits or healthcare costs. Regarding the use of inpatient care, the evidence was insufficient. No evidence was found for a beneficial effect of comprehensive care on caregiver-related outcomes. CONCLUSION: Despite the fact that over the years several (good-quality) studies have been performed to estimate the value of comprehensive care for multimorbid and/or frail patients, evidence for their effectiveness remains insufficient. More good-quality studies and/or studies allowing meta-analysis are needed to determine which specific target groups at what moment will benefit from comprehensive care. Moreover, evaluation studies could improve by using more appropriate outcome measures, e.g. measures that relate to patient-defined (personal) goals of care.

27008708|t|Tall cell variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma: current evidence on clinicopathologic features and molecular biology.
27008708|a|UNASSIGNED: Tall cell variant (TCV) of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) has been recognized for the past few decades as an entity showing aggressive biological behavior; however, there is considerable controversy regarding the definition, clinical and pathological features of TCV because of its rarity and difficult diagnosis. No clinical features can accurately diagnose TCV. Thus, the results of histocytology, immunohistochemistry and molecular genetics tests have important clinical implications for diagnosis. Given the aggressiveness and the increased recurrence and poor survival rates, more aggressive treatment approach and rigorous follow-up is required for patients with TCV. In the present article, we undertook a comprehensive review to summarize and discuss the various aspects of this variant, from morphology to immunohistochemistry, and molecular abnormalities from a practical and daily practice-oriented point of view.

27118718|t|Health and Disease at Age 100.
27118718|a|BACKGROUND: Centenarian studies from around the world have shown that reaching age 100 typically involves substantial health issues. The present study adds to the existing knowledge from other countries by describing health conditions in German centenarians. METHODS: A total of 112 centenarians or their primary contacts provided information on acute and chronic health conditions and pain in the context of the Second Heidelberg Centenarian Study (mean age = 100.45 years, standard deviation [SD] = 0.47, 89% females). RESULTS: Participants showed high comorbidity, with an average of five illnesses (mean = 5.3; SD = 2.20). Health conditions with highest prevalence were sensory (vision, hearing; 94%), mobility (72%) and musculoskeletal conditions (60%). Cardiovascular conditions (57%) and urinary system ailments (55%) were also common. Pain was experienced often by 30% of the participants. Of those reporting any pain, 36% indicated pain exceeding bearable levels. CONCLUSION: German centenarians experienced a substantial number of ill nesses, dominated by sensory and mobility conditions. Cardiovascular diseases were the only potentially lethal illnesses with high prevalence. Evidence of unaddressed pain seems alarming, requiring future research. Emerging health profiles indicate that even in very advanced age, quality of life may be improved by enhanced diagnostics and optimal disease management. Mobility limitations may be addressed with preventive efforts.

27008088|t|Changes in the MicroRNA Profile of the Mandible of Ovariectomized Mice.
27008088|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: In postmenopausal women, a decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) at the hip and spine is associated with an increased risk of tooth loss, possibly caused by the loss of the alveolar bone. The present study explored the effect of the ovariectomy (OVX) of mice on the miRNA expression profile of their bones. METHODS: Micro-CT and histological analysis were performed on mice following OVX or sham-operation using the right mandibles. The left mandibles were used for microarray and quantitative RT-PCR to explore the change in their miRNA expression profile. The differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRs) of the OVX and sham-operated mice were analyzed by constructing the miRNA-mRNA-function complex network. We then also analyzed the different roles of the regulation of miRNAs in the mandible and femur by combining public data from GEO. RESULTS: OVX could lead to a significant decrease in the BMD in the mandible. A total of 53 DEmiRs including, 18 up-regulated and 35 down-regulated miRNAs, were identified. The analysis of the miRNA-mRNA-pathway complex network suggested that miR-17-5p and miRNA-297a-5p were potential biomarkers in the development of mandibles of OVX mice. A comparison of the analysis data on the mandible and femur showed that the transforming growth factor-b signaling pathway was specifically regulated in the mandible, whereas the Wnt signaling pathway was specifically regulated in the femur. Moreover, miR-17-5p and miR-133a-3p showed different expression tendencies in the mandible and in the femur after OVX. CONCLUSION: This study provides an integrated function analysis of miRNA in mandibles after OVX and of miR-17-5p and miR-133a-3p as potential biomarkers. Moreover, the mechanism in mandibles may not be comparable with that in femurs with estrogen deficiency.

27114962|t|Delayed Ischemic Stroke after Flow Diversion of Large Posterior Communicating Artery Aneurysm.
27114962|a|For securing large, giant, and wide-neck aneurysms, conventional coil embolization has substantial limitations, such as incomplete occlusion, recanalization, and a high recurrence rate. To overcome these limitations, a novel paradigm was suggested and, as a result, flow-diverting device was developed. The flow-diverting device is an innovative and effective technique to allow securing of large, giant, and wide-neck aneurysms. In numerous studies, the flow-diverting device has shown better outcomes than coil embolization. However, the flow-diverting device has also some risks, including rupture of aneurysm, intracerebral hemorrhage, and ischemic stroke. In addition, with more experience, unexpected complications are also reported.5)7) In the present case, we experienced a delayed ischemic stroke at 27 days after endovascular treatment. The patient had multiple aneurysms and, among them, we treated a large posterior communicating artery aneurysm using Pipeline    Embolization Device. The patient was tolerable for 25 days, but then suddenly presented intermittent right hemiparesis. In the initial diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), there was no acute lesion; however, in the follow-up MRI, an acute ischemic stroke was found in the territory of anterior choroidal artery which was covered by Pipeline Embolization Device. We suspect that neo-intimal overgrowth or a tiny thrombus have led to this delayed complication. Through our case, we learned that the neurosurgeon should be aware of the possibility of delayed ischemic stroke after flow diversion, as well as, long-term close observation and follow-up angiography are necessary even in the event of no acute complications.

27110811|t|Measles Virus Fusion Protein: Structure, Function and Inhibition.
27110811|a|Measles virus (MeV), a highly contagious member of the Paramyxoviridae family, causes measles in humans. The Paramyxoviridae family of negative single-stranded enveloped viruses includes several important human and animal pathogens, with MeV causing approximately 120,000 deaths annually. MeV and canine distemper virus (CDV)-mediated diseases can be prevented by vaccination. However, sub-optimal vaccine delivery continues to foster MeV outbreaks. Post-exposure prophylaxis with antivirals has been proposed as a novel strategy to complement vaccination programs by filling herd immunity gaps. Recent research has shown that membrane fusion induced by the morbillivirus glycoproteins is the first critical step for viral entry and infection, and determines cell pathology and disease outcome. Our molecular understanding of morbillivirus-associated membrane fusion has greatly progressed towards the feasibility to control this process by treating the fusion glycoprotein with inhibitory molecules. Current approaches to develop anti-membrane fusion drugs and our knowledge on drug resistance mechanisms strongly suggest that combined therapies will be a prerequisite. Thus, discovery of additional anti-fusion and/or anti-attachment protein small-molecule compounds may eventually translate into realistic therapeutic options.

27110603|t|Comparison of three different crown-lengthening procedures in the maxillary anterior esthetic regions.
27110603|a|OBJECTIVE: A papilla preservation crown-lengthening procedure (PPCL) was proposed for treatment of the maxillary anterior teeth (canine to canine) and compared to two traditional techniques. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Thirty patients were assigned to three treatment groups: PPCL, the apically positioned flap with buccal approach (APF-B), and the apically positioned flap with buccal and palatal approach (APF-BP). Several clinical parameters were recorded at baseline and 6 months after surgery. RESULTS: Although no statistically significant differences were reported in many of the clinical parameters examined, APF-B and APF-BP showed a significantly higher interproximal clinical attachment loss when compared to PPCL. In the PPCL group, there was a significant increase in esthetic appraisal by the patients. CONCLUSION: Crown lengthening using a papilla-preservation flap approach and osseous recontouring is a viable alternative approach and could be useful in esthetic regions.

27110562|t|A Rapid In-Clinic Test Detects Acute Leptospirosis in Dogs with High Sensitivity and Specificity.
27110562|a|A rapid IgM-detection immunochromatographic test (WITNESS   Lepto, Zoetis) has recently become available to identify acute canine leptospirosis at the point of care. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the test were evaluated by comparison with the microscopic agglutination assay (MAT), using a positive cut-off titer of >= 800. Banked serum samples from dogs exhibiting clinical signs and suspected leptospirosis were selected to form three groups based on MAT titer: (1) positive (n = 50); (2) borderline (n = 35); and (3) negative (n = 50). Using an analysis to weight group sizes to reflect French prevalence, the sensitivity and specificity were 98% and 93.5% (88.2% unweighted), respectively. This test rapidly identifies cases of acute canine leptospirosis with high levels of sensitivity and specificity with no interference from previous vaccination.

27110374|t|Protein expression and genetic variability of canine Can f 1 in golden and Labrador retriever service dogs.
27110374|a|BACKGROUND: Valued for trainability in diverse tasks, dogs are the primary service animal used to assist individuals with disabilities. Despite their utility, many people in need of service dogs are sensitive to the primary dog allergen, Can f 1, encoded by the Lipocalin 1 gene (LCN1). Several organizations specifically breed service dogs to meet special needs and would like to reduce allergenic potential if possible. In this study, we evaluated the expression of Can f 1 protein and the inherent variability of LCN1 in two breeds used extensively as service dogs. Saliva samples from equal numbers of male and female Labrador retrievers (n   =   12), golden retrievers (n   =   12), and Labrador-golden crosses (n   =   12) were collected 1  h after the morning meal. Can f 1 protein concentrations in the saliva were measured by ELISA, and the LCN1 5' and 3' UTRs and exons sequenced. RESULTS: There was no sex effect (p   >   0.2) nor time-of-day effect; however, Can f 1 protein levels varied by breed with Labrador retrievers being lower than golden retrievers (3.18        0.51 and 5.35        0.52   g/ml, respectively, p   <   0.0075), and the Labrador-golden crosses having intermediate levels (3.77        0.48   g/ml). Although several novel SNPs were identified in LCN1, there were no significant breed-specific sequence differences in the gene and no association of LCN1 genotypes with Can f 1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: As service dogs, Labrador retrievers likely have lower allergenic potential and, though there were no DNA sequence differences identified, classical genetic selection on the estimated breeding values associated with salivary Can f 1 expression may further reduce that potential.

27164945|t|Vascular leiomyoma of the nasal cavity: case report and literature review.
27164945|a|UNASSIGNED: We report a case of a 54-year-old man with an angioleiomyoma originating from the right nasal floor. Nasal vascular leiomyomas are extremely rare tumours. A review of the literature revealed a limited number of cases of vascular leiomyoma in the nasal cavity. Clinically, they are characterised by nasal obstruction, epistaxis or pain as the primary symptom. Up to our knowledge, this is the first case in which a 3D CT scan was performed preoperatively. 3D CT scan reconstructions can show the delineation of the tumour very accurately helping to establish the therapeutic plan for removal. The definite diagnosis can only be confirmed by histopathology. Histopathologically, a vascular leiomyoma demonstrates proliferation of smooth muscle cells intermingled with dilated venous vessels.

27107312|t|Clinical outcomes following "off-label" versus "established" indications of bioresorbable scaffolds for the treatment of coronary artery disease in a real-world population.
27107312|a|AIMS: Our aim was to investigate one-year outcomes in patients treated with bioresorbable scaffolds (BRS) for "off-label" versus currently "established" indications. METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive patients treated with BRS between May 2012 and September 2014 in two centres were retrospectively recruited. Patients who met inclusion criteria as defined by the ABSORB III study were allocated to the established indication group (ESTG; 21 patients with 35 lesions) and the remaining patients to the off-label group (OFLG; 168 patients with 225 lesions). Target vessel failure (TVF) and ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularisation (id-TLR) at one year were evaluated in both groups. Patients in the OFLG had a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus and longer lesion length. Predilatation, post-dilatation and intracoronary imaging were conducted in the majority of patients. At one-year follow-up, TVF (0% vs. 7.8%, p=0.32) and id-TLR (0% vs. 4.5%, p=0.31) occurred only in the OFLG with no adverse events in the ESTG. Definite stent thrombosis occurred in two OFLG patients (1.3%). CONCLUSIONS: In a real-world setting, the majority (88.9%) of patients were treated with BRS for off-label indications. Off-label use of BRS appears to be associated with an acceptable occurrence of outcomes considering the greater complexity of this patient group.

27084261|t|Image-based DNA ploidy analysis aids prediction of malignant transformation in oral lichen planus.
27084261|a|OBJECTIVES: To investigate the potential of image-based DNA ploidy analysis to predict malignant transformation in patients with oral lichen planus (OLP). STUDY DESIGN: DNA ploidy analysis was performed on biopsy samples from 14 patients with OLP who underwent malignant transformation. As controls, 42 OLP lesions showing unusual clinical features suggesting a transformation risk and 68 samples of clinically and histologically typical OLP were included. Cases with dysplasia on initial biopsy were excluded. Eighty fibroepithelial polyps acted as methodologic controls. Epithelial nuclei were isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded biopsy samples and monolayers stained with Feulgen for automated image cytometry to establish DNA content. Ploidy status was correlated to outcome using Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank Mantel-Cox tests. RESULTS: All controls and typical OLP were diploid and none underwent malignant transformation in mean follow-up of 14  years (10-18  years). One unusual OLP developed carcinoma and all were diploid. The 14 patients with transformation developed 21 carcinomas. In the 11 patients who had a prior biopsy, 4 were aneuploid. CONCLUSIONS: DNA ploidy analysis predicted malignant transformation in more than one third (36.4%) of patients with OLP with a preceding biopsy (n  =  11). This premalignant nature could not have been diagnosed clinically or by histologic dysplasia assessment.

27076087|t|LDOC1 Gene Expression in Men With Klinefelter Syndrome.
27076087|a|UNASSIGNED: Klinefelter syndrome (KS) results from an extra chromosome X, which is due to the failure of normal chromosomal segregation during meiosis. Patients with KS have gynecomastia, small testes, and azoospermia. Apoptosis is a mechanism responsible for the normal regulation of spermatogenesis. LDOC1 gene is a known regulator of nuclear factor mediated pathway to apoptosis through inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB). Furthermore, the transcription factor myeloid zinc finger gene 1 (MZF-1) has been shown to interact with LDOC1 and to enhance LDOC1 activity favoring apoptosis. We investigated the expression of LDOC1 gene mRNA, by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), in peripheral blood leukocytes of 13 patients with KS compared to 13 healthy men chosen as controls. LDOC1 expression was higher in 9 of the 13 KS patient compared to normal controls. These finding led us to hypothesize that LDOC1 gene upregulation may play a role in the spermatogenesis derangement observed in patients with KS.

27027499|t|Caregivers' Experiences of Pathways to Care for Seriously Ill Children in Cape Town, South Africa: A Qualitative Investigation.
27027499|a|PURPOSE: Understanding caregivers' experiences of care can identify barriers to timely and good quality care, and support the improvement of services. We aimed to explore caregivers' experiences and perceptions of pathways to care, from first access through various levels of health service, for seriously ill and injured children in Cape Town, South Africa, in order to identify areas for improvement. METHODS: Semi-structured, qualitative interviews were conducted with primary caregivers of children who were admitted to paediatric intensive care or died in the health system prior to intensive care admission. Interviews explored caregivers' experiences from when their child first became ill, through each level of health care to paediatric intensive care or death. A maximum variation sample of transcripts was purposively sampled from a larger cohort study based on demographic characteristics, child diagnosis, and outcome at 30 days; and analysed using the method of constant comparison. RESULTS: Of the 282 caregivers who were interviewed in the larger cohort study, 45 interviews were included in this qualitative analysis. Some caregivers employed 'tactics' to gain quicker access to care, including bypassing lower levels of care, and negotiating or demanding to see a healthcare professional ahead of other patients. It was sometimes unclear how to access emergency care within facilities; and non-medical personnel informally judged illness severity and helped or hindered quicker access. Caregivers commonly misconceived ambulances to be slow to arrive, and were concerned when ambulance transfers were seemingly not prioritised by illness severity. Communication was often good, but some caregivers experienced language difficulties and/or criticism. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to improve child health care could be based on: reorganising the reception of seriously ill children and making the emergency route within healthcare facilities clear; promoting caregivers' use of ambulances and prioritising transfers according to illness severity; addressing language barriers, and emphasising the importance of effective communication to healthcare providers.

27028731|t|Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) Prefer and Are Less Aggressive in Darker Environments.
27028731|a|Fish are capable of excellent vision and can be profoundly influenced by the visual properties of their environment. Ambient colours have been found to affect growth, survival, aggression and reproduction, but the effect of background darkness (i.e., the darkness vs. lightness of the background) on preference and aggression has not been evaluated systematically. One-hundred Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), a species that is increasing in popularity in aquaculture, were randomly assigned to 10 tanks. Using a Latin-square design, every tank was bisected to allow fish in each tank to choose between all the following colour choices (8 choices in total): black vs. white, light grey, dark grey, and a mixed dark grey/black pattern, as well as industry-standard blue vs. white, light grey, dark grey, and black. Fish showed a strong preference for black backgrounds over all other options (p < 0.01). Across tests, preference strength increased with background darkness (p < 0.0001). Moreover, having darker backgrounds in the environment resulted in less aggressive behaviour throughout the tank (p < 0.0001). These results provide the first evidence that darker tanks are preferred by and decrease aggression in salmonids, which points to the welfare benefits of housing farmed salmon in enclosures containing dark backgrounds.

27042272|t|New risk-scoring system including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease for predicting incident type  2 diabetes in East China: Shanghai Baosteel Cohort.
27042272|a|AIMS/INTRODUCTION: The present study aimed to explore the incidence of type 2 diabetes, and to develop a risk-scoring model for predicting diabetes among the adult health check-up population in East China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants from the Shanghai Baosteel Cohort (age >= 20  years) without diabetes at baseline were recruited in a 6-year follow-up study. In order to explore risk factors for diabetes, this cohort was categorized into two groups: new diabetes and no diabetes. Three models were developed by Cox regression analysis. The model accuracy was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: A total of 6,542 individuals were included in the Shanghai Baosteel Cohort Study. Of them, 368 (5.6%) developed type  2 diabetes at the end of the follow-up period. Cox regression analysis found a close association between incident type  2 diabetes and several risk factors including non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases at baseline. The Shanghai Baosteel Score including advanced age (2 points), hypertriglyceridemia (2 points), obesity (2 points), non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (2 points) and impaired fasting glucose (3 points) had a good diagnostic performance with estimated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.724), sensitivity (57.9%) and specificity (72.2%) at a cut-off point of >3. CONCLUSIONS: A risk-scoring system including non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases can help identify individuals at a high risk of diabetes in the East Chinese population.

27051450|t|Effect of Dangguibohyul-Tang, a Mixed Extract of Astragalus membranaceus and Angelica sinensis, on Allergic and Inflammatory Skin Reaction Compared with Single Extracts of Astragalus membranaceus or Angelica sinensis.
27051450|a|Dangguibohyul-tang (DBT), herbal formula composed of Astragalus membranaceus (AM) and Angelica sinensis (AS) at a ratio of 5   :   1, has been used for the treatment of various skin diseases in traditional medicine. We investigated the effect of DBT on allergic and inflammatory skin reaction in atopic dermatitis-like model compared to the single extract of AM or AS. DBT treatment showed the remission of clinical symptoms, including decreased skin thickness and scratching behavior, the total serum IgE level, and the number of mast cells compared to DNCB group as well as the single extract of AM- or AS-treated group. Levels of cytokines (IL-4, IL-6, IFN-y, TNF-a, and IL-1b) and inflammatory mediators (NF-kB, phospho-IkBa, and phospho-MAPKs) were significantly decreased in AM, AS, and DBT groups. These results demonstrated that AM, AS, and DBT may have the therapeutic property on atopic dermatitis by inhibition of allergic and inflammatory mediators and DBT formula; a mixed extract of AM and AS based on the herb pairs theory especially might be more effective on antiallergic reaction as compared with the single extract of AM or AS.

27022388|t|Bile duct stone formation around a Prolene suture after cholangioenterostomy.
27022388|a|The iatrogenic cause of bile duct stone formation is mainly due to suture materials, especially silk sutures. In recent years, Prolene and Vicryl sutures have been widely used in biliary surgery, and bile duct stone formation related to sutures are seemingly becoming rare, as there has only been one report of bile duct stone formation caused by Prolene sutures in the literature. In the last few years we have had two cases of Prolene suture-related bile duct stone formation within our unit. We therefore suggest that Vicryl sutures should be used as the first choice in biliary surgery, in order to prevent the formation of iatrogenic bile duct stones.

27025568|t|Survival of the Grittiest? Consultant Surgeons Are Significantly Grittier Than Their Junior Trainees.
27025568|a|OBJECTIVE: "Grit" can be defined as the passion and perseverance for long-term goals, and it can be measured by a validated scale. It has been associated with success in diverse fields such as basic military training and spelling tests. Surgical training is arduous with large number of trainees reporting burnout, and it could be expected that grit is a fundamental requirement to complete training. This study aimed to examine the relationship of grit in surgical training, whether grit varies by grade of surgeon, and the association of grit with burnout. DESIGN: This was a prospective survey-based study, using the validated tools Short Grit Scale and Oldenburg Burnout Inventory. SETTING: UK-based ear, nose, and throat doctors based in secondary care were invited to participate. PARTICIPANTS: Ear, nose, and throat surgeons were used as the sample population, with subgroups of core trainees (core surgical trainees), specialist registrars (higher surgical training), and consultants. RESULTS: A total of 102 participants completed the study (33 core surgical trainees, 49 mid-career trainees in higher surgical training, and 22 consultants). Consultants were significantly grittier than trainees (p < 0.05). Grit had a significant inverse relationship with burnout (r = -0.54, p < 0.05). There was a nonsignificant trend of reduced burnout in consultants. Age and sex were not associated with grit or burnout. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reinforce the concept that grit is fundamentally important to completion of surgical training. In addition, grittier individuals are more likely to resist burnout than their less gritty counterparts. These findings carry implications for retention and recruitment of trainee surgeons, and further study is required to investigate whether surgical training influences grit levels or selects out the grittiest trainees to survive to completion.

27105325|t|Boolean modeling techniques for protein co-expression networks in systems medicine.
27105325|a|UNASSIGNED: Application of systems biology /systems medicine approaches is promising for proteomics /biomedical research, but requires selection of an adequate modeling type. This article reviews the existing Boolean network modeling approaches, which provide in comparison with alternative modeling techniques several advantages for the processing of proteomics data. Application of methods for inference, reduction and validation of protein co-expression networks that are derived from quantitative high-throughput proteomics measurements is presented. It's also shown how Boolean models can be used to derive system-theoretic characteristics that describe both the dynamical behavior of such networks as a whole and the properties of different cell states (e.g. healthy or diseased cell states). Furthermore, application of methods derived from control theory is proposed in order to simulate the effects of therapeutic interventions on such networks, which is a promising approach for the computer-assisted discovery of biomarkers and drug targets. Finally, the clinical application of Boolean modeling analyses is discussed.

27067236|t|Sequential phenotypic constraints on social information use in wild baboons.
27067236|a|Social information allows the rapid dissemination of novel information among individuals. However, an individual's ability to use information is likely to be dependent on phenotypic constraints operating at three successive steps: acquisition, application, and exploitation. We tested this novel framework by quantifying the sequential process of social information use with experimental food patches in wild baboons (Papio ursinus). We identified phenotypic constraints at each step of the information use sequence: peripheral individuals in the proximity network were less likely to acquire and apply social information, while subordinate females were less likely to exploit it successfully. Social bonds and personality also played a limiting role along the sequence. As a result of these constraints, the average individual only acquired and exploited social information on.

27157752|t|Impact of alginate concentration on the viability, cryostorage, and angiogenic activity of encapsulated fibroblasts.
27157752|a|Cryopreservation or cryostorage of tissue engineered constructs can enhance the off-the shelf availability of these products and thus can potentially facilitate the commercialization or clinical translation of tissue engineered products. Encapsulation of cells within hydrogel matrices, in particular alginate, is widely used for fabrication of tissue engineered constructs. While previous studies have explored the cryopreservation response of cells encapsulated within alginate matrices, systematic investigation of the impact of alginate concentration on the metabolic activity and functionality of cryopreserved cells is lacking. The objective of the present work is to determine the metabolic and angiogenic activity of cryopreserved human dermal fibroblasts encapsulated within 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0% (w/v) alginate matrices. In addition, the goal is to compare the efficacy of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and trehalose as cryoprotectant. Our study revealed that the concentration of alginate plays a significant role in the cryopreservation response of encapsulated cells. The lowest metabolic activity of the cryopreserved cells was observed in 1% alginate microspheres. When higher concentration of alginate was utilized for cell encapsulation, the metabolic and angiogenic activity of the cells frozen in the absence of cryoprotectants was comparable to that observed in the presence of DMSO or trehalose.

27075261|t|Experimental models of hepatitis B and C - new insights and progress.
27075261|a|UNASSIGNED: Viral hepatitis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Hepatitis-causing viruses initiate disease by establishing both acute and chronic infections, and several of these viruses are specifically associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Consequently, intense research efforts have been focusing on increasing our understanding of hepatitis virus biology and on improving antiviral therapy and vaccination strategies. Although valuable information on viral hepatitis emerged from careful epidemiological studies on sporadic outbreaks in humans, experimental models using cell culture, rodent and non-human primates were essential in advancing the field. Through the use of these experimental models, improvement in both the treatment and prevention of viral hepatitis has progressed rapidly; however, agents of viral hepatitis are still among the most common pathogens infecting humans. In this Review, we describe the important part that these experimental models have played in the study of viral hepatitis and led to monumental advances in our understanding and treatment of these pathogens. Ongoing developments in experimental models are also described.

27165126|t|Novel patient-derived xenograft mouse model for pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma demonstrates single agent activity of oxaliplatin.
27165126|a|BACKGROUND: Pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (PACC) is a rare malignancy, accounting for  <1  % of all pancreatic neoplasms. Very few retrospective studies are available to help guide management. We previously reported the case of a patient with metastatic PACC who achieved prolonged survival following doxorubicin treatment. Personalized treatment was based on molecular and in vitro data collected from primary cells developed from their liver metastasis. We now report the characterization of a patient derived tumor xenograft (PDTX) mouse model that originated from this patient's PACC liver metastasis. METHODS: Fragments of biopsy tissue (5  mm(3)) from PACC liver metastasis were implanted into athymic nude mice. Tumors were grown and passaged from the host mice into new mice to be tested for therapeutic response. Immuno-histochemical (IHC) biomarkers were used to confirm that the PDTX model represents human PACC. The antitumor activities of multiple drugs (5-FU, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, gemcitabine, bevacizumab, erlotinib, doxorubicin and imatinib) were tested. Tumor size was measured over 74  days or until they reached an endpoint volume of  ~800  mm(3). Tests to measure serum lipase levels and histological analyses of tumor tissues were also conducted to assess PACC progression and re-differentiation. RESULTS: The model presented here expresses the same IHC markers found in human PACC. In the chemotherapy study, oxaliplatin produced a prolonged durable growth response associated with increased apoptosis, decreased serum lipase levels and increased healthy acinar cells. Bevacizumab also produced a significant growth response, but the effect was not prolonged as demonstrated by oxaliplatin treatment. The other chemotherapies had moderate to little effect, particularly after treatment ceased. Mutations in DNA repair genes are common in PACC and increase tumor susceptibility to oxaliplatin. To explore this we performed IHC and found no nuclear expression of BRCA2 in our model, indicating a mutation affecting nuclear localization. Gene sequencing confirms BRCA2 has a homozygous gene deletion on Exon 10, which frequently causes a protein truncation. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we report the development and characterization of the first and only preclinical PACC PDTX model. Here we show sustained anti-tumor activity of single agent oxaliplatin, a compound that is more effective in tumors that harbor mutations in DNA repair genes. Our data shows that BRCA2 is mutated in our PACC model, which could contribute to the oxaliplatin sensitivity observed. Further studies on this rare PACC model can serve to elucidate other novel therapies, biomarkers, and molecular mechanisms of signaling and drug resistance.

27051544|t|Recurrent Pseudomembranous Colitis in an Ovarian Cancer Patient Undergoing Carboplatin Chemotherapy.
27051544|a|Background. Diarrhea is a common problem in ovarian cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and Clostridium difficile infection has been identified as a cause. The proper diagnosis and treatment of diarrhea are critical to patient care, especially to prevent the serious complications from a severe Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Case. We present a heavily pretreated ovarian cancer patient who developed recurrent pseudomembranous colitis while receiving carboplatin chemotherapy. Despite treatment with oral metronidazole for fourteen days, the patient's diarrhea relapsed and colonoscopy revealed extensive pseudomembranous colitis. The infection eventually resolved with the combination of oral vancomycin and metronidazole. Conclusions. Diarrhea is a common problem in patients undergoing chemotherapy for ovarian cancer. Management requires obtaining the proper diagnosis. Clostridium difficile associated pseudomembranous colitis must be part of the differential diagnosis. Treatment must be sufficient to prevent relapses of the Clostridium difficile infection to prevent serious consequences in an already vulnerable patient population.

27093686|t|Are classic predictors of voltage valid in cardiac amyloidosis? A contemporary analysis of electrocardiographic findings.
27093686|a|BACKGROUND: Low voltage electrocardiography (ECG) coupled with increased ventricular wall thickness is the hallmark of cardiac amyloidosis. However, patient characteristics influencing voltage in the general population, including bundle branch block, have not been evaluated in amyloid heart disease. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of patients with newly diagnosed cardiac amyloidosis from 2002 to 2014. ECG voltage was calculated using limb (sum of QRS complex in leads I, II and III) and precordial (Sokolow: S in V1 plus R in V5-V6) criteria. The associations between voltage and clinical variables were tested using multivariable linear regression. A Cox model assessed the association of voltage with mortality. RESULTS: In 389 subjects (transthyretin ATTR 186, light chain AL 203), 30% had conduction delay (QRS >120ms). In those with narrow QRS, 68% met low limb, 72% low Sokolow and 57% both criteria, with lower voltages found in AL vs ATTR. LV mass index as well as other typical factors that impact voltage (age, sex, race, hypertension, BSA, and smoking) in the general population were not associated with voltage in this cardiac amyloidosis cohort. Patients with LBBB and IVCD had similar voltages when compared to those with narrow QRS. Voltage was significantly associated with mortality (p<0.001 for both criteria) after multivariable adjustment. CONCLUSION: Classic predictors of ECG voltage in the general population are not valid in cardiac amyloidosis. In this cohort, the prevalence estimates of ventricular conduction delay and low voltage are higher than previously reported. Voltage predicts mortality after multivariable adjustment.

27085396|t|Spore test parameters matter: Mesophilic and thermophilic spore counts detected in raw milk and dairy powders differ significantly by test method.
27085396|a|UNASSIGNED: United States dairy industry exports have steadily risen in importance over the last 10 yr, with dairy powders playing a particularly critical role. Currently, approximately half of US-produced nonfat dry milk and skim milk powder is exported. Reaching new and expanding existing export markets relies in part on the control of endospore-forming bacteria in dairy powders. This study reports baseline mesophilic and thermophilic spore counts and spore populations from 55 raw material samples (primarily raw milk) and 33 dairy powder samples from dairy powder processors across the United States. Samples were evaluated using various spore testing methodologies and included initial heat treatments of (1) 80  C for 12 min; (2) 100  C for 30 min; and (3) 106  C for 30 min. Results indicate that significant differences in both the level and population of spores were found for both raw milk and dairy powders with the various testing methods. Additionally, on average, spore counts were not found to increase significantly from the beginning to the end of dairy powder processing, most likely related to the absence of biofilm formation by processing plant-associated sporeformers (e.g., Anoxybacillus sp.) in the facilities sampled. Finally, in agreement with other studies, Bacillus licheniformis was found to be the most prevalent sporeformer in both raw materials and dairy powders, highlighting the importance of this organism in developing strategies for control and reduction of spore counts in dairy powders. Overall, this study emphasizes the need for standardization of spore enumeration methodologies in the dairy powder industry.

27045536|t|Closantel Suppresses Angiogenesis and Cancer Growth in Zebrafish Models.
27045536|a|UNASSIGNED: Angiogenesis has emerged as an important therapeutic target in several major diseases, including cancer and age-related macular degeneration. The zebrafish offer the potential for high-throughput drug discovery in a whole vertebrate system. In this study, we have taken advantage of the transgenic Tg (fli1a:EGFP) zebrafish line to screen the U.S. Drug Collection Library and identified 11 old drugs with antiangiogenic activity, including Closantel, an FDA-approved broad-spectrum salicylanilide antiparasitic drug for a variety of types of animals. Closantel was confirmed to have antiangiogenic activity in zebrafish with a half-inhibitory concentration (IC50) at 1.69    M on the intersegmental vessels and 1.45    M on the subintestinal vessels. Closantel also markedly suppressed cancer growth in zebrafish xenotransplanted with human lymphoma, cervical cancer, pancreatic cancer, and liver cancer cells, generally in a dose-dependent manner. These data reveal that Closantel has antiangiogenesis and anticancer effects and could be a potential drug candidate for animal and human cancer treatments. Further study is needed to clarify the mechanisms involved in the antiangiogenesis and anticancer effects of Closantel.

27028128|t|A Randomised Controlled Trial of Consent Procedures for the Use of Residual Tissues for Medical Research: Preferences of and Implications for Patients, Research and Clinical Practice.
27028128|a|BACKGROUND: Despite much debate, there is little evidence on consequences of consent procedures for residual tissue use. Here, we investigated these consequences for the availability of residual tissue for medical research, clinical practice, and patient informedness. METHODS: We conducted a randomised clinical trial with three arms in six hospitals. Participants, patients from whom tissue had been removed for diagnosis or treatment, were randomised to one of three arms: informed consent, an opt-out procedure with active information provision (opt-out plus), and an opt-out procedure without active information provision. Participants received a questionnaire six weeks post-intervention; a subsample of respondents was interviewed. Health care providers completed a pre- and post-intervention questionnaire. We assessed percentage of residual tissue samples available for medical research, and patient and health care provider satisfaction and preference. Health care providers and outcome assessors could not be blinded. RESULTS: We randomised 1,319 patients, 440 in the informed consent, 434 in the opt-out plus, and 445 in the opt-out arm; respectively 60.7%, 100%, and 99.8% of patients' tissue samples could be used for medical research. Of the questionnaire respondents (N = 224, 207, and 214 in the informed consent, opt-out plus, and opt-out arms), 71%, 69%, and 31%, respectively, indicated being (very) well informed. By questionnaire, the majority (53%) indicated a preference for informed consent, whereas by interview, most indicated a preference for opt-out plus (37%). Health care providers (N = 35) were more likely to be (very) satisfied with opt-out plus than with informed consent (p = 0.002) or opt-out (p = 0.039); the majority (66%) preferred opt-out plus. CONCLUSION: We conclude that opt-out with information (opt-out plus) is the best choice to balance the consequences for medical research, patients, and clinical practice, and is therefore the most optimal consent procedure for residual tissue use in Dutch hospitals.

27079461|t|Variability of whipworm infection and humoral immune response in a wild population of mole voles (Ellobius talpinus Pall.).
27079461|a|UNASSIGNED: Restricted mobility and spatial isolation of social units in gregarious subterranean mammals ensure good defence mechanisms against parasites, which in turn allows for a reduction of immunity components. In contrast, a parasite invasion may cause an increased adaptive immune response. Therefore, it can be expected that spatial and temporal distribution of parasites within a population will correlate with the local variability in the host's immunocompetence. To test this hypothesis, the intra-population variability of a whipworm infestation and the humoral immune response to non-replicated antigens in mole voles (Ellobius talpinus Pall.), social subterranean rodents, was estimated. Whipworm prevalence in mole voles increased from spring to autumn, and this tendency was more pronounced in settlements living in natural meadows compared to settlements in man-made meadows. However, humoral immune response was lowest in animals from natural meadows trapped in autumn. Since whipworm infestation does not directly affect the immunity of mole voles, the reciprocal tendencies in seasonal dynamics and spatial distribution of whipworm abundance and host immunocompetence may be explained by local deterioration of habitat conditions, which increases the probability of an infestation.

27109747|t|Can immunosuppressive therapy facilitate the diagnosis and affect the clinical signs of canine scabies? A retrospective study of 79 cases.
27109747|a|BACKGROUND: Scabies infestation is one of the most pruritic dermatoses of dogs. It is often misdiagnosed and dogs are treated with immunomodulatory drugs (IMD) to relieve pruritus. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The primary goals of this study were to determine the impact of IMD on skin scraping results, pruritus level and extent of skin lesions, and to evaluate whether disease duration is associated with positive skin scrapings and contagion. ANIMALS: Seventy nine dogs with a final diagnosis of scabies. METHODS: Inclusion in this retrospective study required a positive skin scraping for scabies or a clinical response to an acaricidal treatment trial. RESULTS: The average pruritus score of dogs that received IMD (8.71) was significantly higher than those that did not (7.43; P = 0.03). However, there were no significant differences in either the rates of positive skin scrapings (79.6% versus 59.1%; P = 0.13) or the mean number of body sites affected (3.8 versus 3.4; P = 0.30) between dogs that received IMD and those that did not. Neither skin scraping status nor duration of clinical signs were correlated with a report of contagion within the household. CONCLUSION/CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: IMD was associated with a significant increase in the pruritus level, but not with the mean number of lesional body sites. Dogs exposed to IMD had a 20.5% higher rate of positive skin scrapings. This difference could be clinically relevant and lack of statistical significance may indicate an underpowered study.

27109068|t|Changes in respiratory function in Pembroke Welsh Corgi dogs with degenerative myelopathy.
27109068|a|UNASSIGNED: Canine degenerative myelopathy (DM) is characterized by progressive degeneration of the spinal cord. Although atrophic changes in the intercostal muscles were previously reported in the late stage of DM in Pembroke Welsh Corgis (PWCs), changes in respiratory function have not yet been examined. In the present study, we performed an arterial blood gas analysis and measured respiratory movements over progressive disease stages to document changes in respiratory function in DM-affected PWCs. We found that respiratory dysfunction progressed during the later stages of DM and correlated with a change in respiratory movement to the abdominal breathing pattern. These results suggested that hypoventilation occurred due to dysfunctional changes in the intercostal muscles and resulted in hypoxemia in the later stages of DM.

27108660|t|New Insights in the Functional Zonation of the Canine Adrenal Cortex.
27108660|a|BACKGROUND: Current understanding of adrenal steroidogenesis is that the production of aldosterone or cortisol depends on the expression of aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) and 11b-hydroxylase cytochrome P450 (CYP11B1), respectively. However, this has never been studied in dogs, and in some species, a single CYP11B catalyzes both cortisol and aldosterone formation. Analysis of the canine genome provides data of a single CYP11B gene which is called CYP11B2, and a large sequence gap exists near the so-called CYP11B2 gene. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the zonal expression of steroidogenic enzymes in the canine adrenal cortex and to determine whether dogs have 1 or multiple CYP11B genes. ANIMALS: Normal adrenal glands from 10 healthy dogs. METHODS: Zona fasciculata (zF) and zona glomerulosa (zG) tissue was isolated by laser microdissection. The mRNA expression of steroidogenic enzymes and their major regulators was studied with RT-qPCR. Southern blot was performed to  determine whether the sequence gap contains a CYP11B gene copy. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed for 17a-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17). RESULTS: Equal expression (P  =  .62) of the so-called CYP11B2 gene was found in the zG and zF. Southern blot revealed a single gene. CYP17 expression (P  =  .05) was significantly higher in the zF compared with the zG, which was confirmed with IHC. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: We conclude that there is only 1 CYP11B gene in canine adrenals. The zone-specific production of aldosterone and cortisol is probably due to zone-specific CYP17 expression, which makes it an attractive target for selective inhibition of cortisol synthesis without affecting mineralocorticoid production in the zG.

27016446|t|Connecting source with sink: the role of Arabidopsis AAP8 in phloem loading of amino acids.
27016446|a|UNASSIGNED: Allocation of large amounts of nitrogen to developing organs occurs in the phloem and is essential for plant growth and seed development. In Arabidopsis and many other plant species, amino acids represent the dominant nitrogen transport forms in the phloem, and they are mainly synthesized in photosynthetically active source leaves. Following their synthesis, a broad spectrum of the amino nitrogen is actively loaded into the phloem of leaf minor veins and transported within the phloem sap to sinks such as developing leaves, fruits or seeds. Controlled regulation of source to sink transport of amino acids has long been postulated, however, the molecular mechanism of amino acid phloem loading was still unknown. In this study, Arabidopsis AMINO ACID PERMEASE8 (AAP8) was shown to be expressed in the source leaf phloem and localized to the plasma membrane, suggesting its function in phloem loading. This was further supported by transport studies with aap8 mutants fed with radiolabelled amino acids and by leaf exudate analyses. In addition, biochemical and molecular analyses revealed alterations in leaf nitrogen pools and metabolism dependent on the developmental stage of the mutants. Decreased amino acid phloem loading and partitioning to sinks led to a decrease silique and seed number, but seed protein levels were unchanged, demonstrating the importance of AAP8 function for sink development rather than seed quality. Overall, the results show that AAP8 plays an important role in source to sink partitioning of N, and that its function affects source leaf physiology and seed yield.

27141148|t|Investigating the usage of point spread functions in point source and microsphere localization.
27141148|a|UNASSIGNED: Using a point spread function (PSF) to localize a point-like object, such as a fluorescent molecule or microsphere, represents a common task in single molecule microscopy image data analysis. The localization may differ in purpose depending on the application or experiment, but a unifying theme is the importance of being able to closely recover the true location of the point-like object with high accuracy. We present two simulation studies, both relating to the performance of object localization via the maximum likelihood fitting of a PSF to the object's image. In the first study, we investigate the integration of the PSF over an image pixel, which represents a critical part of the localization algorithm. Specifically, we explore how the fineness of the integration affects how well a point source can be localized, and find the use of too coarse a step size to produce location estimates that are far from the true location, especially when the images are acquired at relatively low magnifications. We also propose a method for selecting an appropriate step size. In the second study, we investigate the suitability of the common practice of using a PSF to localize a microsphere, despite the mismatch between the microsphere's image and the fitted PSF. Using criteria based on the standard errors of the mean and variance, we find the method suitable for microspheres up to 1  m and 100 nm in diameter, when the localization is performed, respectively, with and without the simultaneous estimation of the width of the PSF.

27148338|t|Overexpression of a Cytosolic Abiotic Stress Responsive Universal Stress Protein (SbUSP) Mitigates Salt and Osmotic Stress in Transgenic Tobacco Plants.
27148338|a|The universal stress protein (USP) is a ubiquitous protein and plays an indispensable role in plant abiotic stress tolerance. The genome of Salicornia brachiata contains two homologs of intron less SbUSP gene which encodes for salt and osmotic responsive USP. In vivo localization reveals that SbUSP is a membrane bound cytosolic protein. The role of the gene was functionally validated by developing transgenic tobacco and compared with control [wild-type (WT) and vector control (VC)] plants under different abiotic stress condition. Transgenic lines (T1) exhibited higher chlorophyll, relative water, proline, total sugar, reducing sugar, free amino acids, polyphenol contents, osmotic potential, membrane stability, and lower electrolyte leakage and lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde content) under stress treatments than control (WT and VC) plants. Lower accumulation of H2O2 and [Formula: see text] radicals was also detected in transgenic lines compared to control plants under stress conditions. Present study confers that overexpression of the SbUSP gene enhances plant growth, alleviates ROS buildup, maintains ion homeostasis and improves the physiological status of the plant under salt and osmotic stresses. Principal component analysis exhibited a statistical distinction of plant response to salinity stress, and a significant response was observed for transgenic lines under stress, which provides stress endurance to the plant. A possible signaling role is proposed that some downstream genes may get activated by abiotic stress responsive cytosolic SbUSP, which leads to the protection of cell from oxidative damages. The study unveils that ectopic expression of the gene mitigates salt or osmotic stress by scavenging ROS and modulating the physiological process of the plant.

27167557|t|Experiences of housing support in everyday life for persons with schizophrenia and the role of the media from a societal perspective.
27167557|a|BACKGROUND: The mental health-care system in Sweden, as in many other counties, has its main focus on the reduction of psychiatric symptoms and the prevention of relapses. People diagnosed with schizophrenia often have significant health issues and experience reduced well-being in everyday life. The social imaginary of mental illness as an imbalance of the brain has implications concerning general attitudes in society. The news media are an important source of information on psychiatric disorders and have an important role in cultivating public perceptions and stigma. News media can contribute to the mental illness stigma and place individuals with mental illnesses at risk of not receiving adequate care and support. The aim of this preliminary study was to describe users' experiences of housing support in everyday life. RESULTS: The results revealed three themes of housing support, which were needed, but frequently insufficiently fulfilled in the municipality. The three themes were: "Support to Practice Healthy Routines in Daily Life," "Support to Shape Meaningful Contents in Everyday Life," and "Support to Meet Needs of Integrity and Respect." CONCLUSIONS: The findings support previous studies arguing that current health care and housing support fails to meet basic needs and may lead to significant and unnecessary health risks. Further investigation is needed regarding the links between attitudes to mental illness in society and political and financial principles for health care and housing support for persons with schizophrenia. Further research is needed regarding the role of the media in policymaking concerning health promotion interventions for people diagnosed with schizophrenia.

27166432|t|Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase Attenuates Methotrexate Response in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis and In Vitro.
27166432|a|UNASSIGNED: Variability in response to methotrexate (MTX) in the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) remains unpredictable and poorly understood. Based on previous studies implicating an interaction between nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) expression and MTX therapy in inflammatory arthritis, we hypothesized that increased NAMPT expression would be associated with reduced therapeutic response to MTX in patients with JIA. A significant association was found between increased plasma concentrations of NAMPT and reduced therapeutic response in patients with JIA treated with MTX. Inhibition of NAMPT in cell culture by either siRNA-based gene silencing or pharmacological inhibition with FK-866 was found to result in a fourfold increase in the pharmacological activity of MTX. Collectively, these findings provide evidence that NAMPT inhibits the pharmacological activity of MTX and may represent a predictive biomarker of response, as well as a therapeutic target, in the treatment of JIA with MTX.

27129233|t|Carboxyl-terminal 20 Amino Acids of Drosophila Topoisomerase 2 Are Required for Binding to a BRCT Domain-containing Protein Mus101 and Fidelity of DNA Segregation.
27129233|a|UNASSIGNED: Eukaryotic Topoisomerase 2 (Top2) and one of its interacting partners, Topoisomerase IIb binding protein 1 (TopBP1) are two proteins performing essential cellular functions. We mapped the interacting domains of these two proteins using the co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments with truncated or mutant Drosophila Top2 with various Ser to Ala substitutions. We discovered that the last 20 amino acids of Top2 represent the key region for binding with Mus101 (Drosophila homolog of TopBP1) and phosphorylation of Ser1428 and Ser1443 is important for Top2 to interact with the N-terminus of Mus101, which contains BRCT1/2 domains (BRCT, BRCA1 C-terminus). The interaction between Mus101 and the Top2 C-terminal regulatory domain is phosphorylation-dependent since treatment with phosphatase abolishes their association in the pull-down assays. The binding affinity of the N-terminal Mus101 with a synthetic phosphorylated peptide spanning the last 25 amino acids of Top2 (with pS1428 and pS1443) was determined by surface plasmon resonance with a Kd of 0.57  M. In an in vitro decatenation assay, Mus101 can specifically reduce the decatenation activity of Top2, and dephosphorylation of Top2 attenuates this response. Next, we endeavored to establish a cellular system for testing the biological function of Top2-Mus101 interaction. Top2-silenced S2 cells rescued by Top2  20, Top2 with 20 amino acids truncated from the C-terminus, developed abnormally high chromosome numbers, which implies that Top2-Mus101 interaction is important for maintaining the fidelity of chromosome segregation during mitosis.

27047316|t|Experimental procedures to identify and validate specific mRNA targets of miRNAs.
27047316|a|Functionally matured microRNAs (miRNAs) are small single-stranded non-coding RNA molecules which are emerging as important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression and consequently are central players in many physiological and pathological processes. Since the biological roles of individual miRNAs will be dictated by the mRNAs that they regulate, the identification and validation of miRNA/mRNA target interactions is critical for our understanding of the regulatory networks governing biological processes. We promulgate the combined use of prediction algorithms, the examination of curated databases of experimentally supported miRNA/mRNA interactions, manual sequence inspection of cataloged miRNA binding sites in specific target mRNAs, and review of the published literature as a reliable practice for identifying and prioritizing biologically important miRNA/mRNA target pairs. Once a preferred miRNA/mRNA target pair has been selected, we propose that the authenticity of a functional miRNA/mRNA target pair be validated by fulfilling four well-defined experimental criteria. This review summarizes our current knowledge of miRNA biology, miRNA/mRNA target prediction algorithms, validated miRNA/mRNA target data bases, and outlines several experimental methods by which miRNA/mRNA targets can be authenticated. In addition, a case study of human endoglin is presented as an example of the utilization of these methodologies.

27029776|t|Short Sleep Duration and Risk of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
27029776|a|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease worldwide. Several studies have suggested that short sleep duration could be a risk factor for NAFLD. However, results of those reports are inconsistent. This meta-analysis was conducted with an attempt to summarize all available data. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was performed using MEDLINE and EMBASE database. Studies that reported relative risks, odd ratios or hazard ratios comparing the risk of NAFLD among participants who had short sleep duration versus those with longer sleep duration were included. Pooled risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect, generic inverse variance method. RESULTS: Six studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The risk of NAFLD in participants who had short sleep duration was significantly higher than participants with longer sleep duration with pooled RR of 1.19 (95% CI, 1.04-1.36, I(2)    =   0%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated a small but significantly increased risk of NAFLD among participants who had short sleep duration. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

27010569|t|The Genetics of Bene Israel from India Reveals Both Substantial Jewish and Indian Ancestry.
27010569|a|UNASSIGNED: The Bene Israel Jewish community from West India is a unique population whose history before the 18th century remains largely unknown. Bene Israel members consider themselves as descendants of Jews, yet the identity of Jewish ancestors and their arrival time to India are unknown, with speculations on arrival time varying between the 8th century BCE and the 6th century CE. Here, we characterize the genetic history of Bene Israel by collecting and genotyping 18 Bene Israel individuals. Combining with 486 individuals from 41 other Jewish, Indian and Pakistani populations, and additional individuals from worldwide populations, we conducted comprehensive genome-wide analyses based on FST, principal component analysis, ADMIXTURE, identity-by-descent sharing, admixture linkage disequilibrium decay, haplotype sharing and allele sharing autocorrelation decay, as well as contrasted patterns between the X chromosome and the autosomes. The genetics of Bene Israel individuals resemble local Indian populations, while at the same time constituting a clearly separated and unique population in India. They are unique among Indian and Pakistani populations we analyzed in sharing considerable genetic ancestry with other Jewish populations. Putting together the results from all analyses point to Bene Israel being an admixed population with both Jewish and Indian ancestry, with the genetic contribution of each of these ancestral populations being substantial. The admixture took place in the last millennium, about 19-33 generations ago. It involved Middle-Eastern Jews and was sex-biased, with more male Jewish and local female contribution. It was followed by a population bottleneck and high endogamy, which can lead to increased prevalence of recessive diseases in this population. This study provides an example of how genetic analysis advances our knowledge of human history in cases where other disciplines lack the relevant data to do so.

27010902|t|Genistein alleviates testicular ischemia and reperfusion injury-induced spermatogenic damage and oxidative stress by suppressing abnormal testicular matrix metalloproteinase system via the Notch 2/Jagged 1/Hes-1 and caspase-8 pathways.
27010902|a|UNASSIGNED: The aim of the study is to examine the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMP) during testicular ischemia/reperfusion (t I/R). The involvement of the Notch pathway, and their modulation by the antioxidant genistein is also studied. Three groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats were used: sham rats, t I/R rats, and genistein-treated rats (10 mg/kg). The t I/R rat model underwent testicular artery occlusion of the left testis and was subjected to 60 min ischemia followed by 4 h reperfusion. Protein expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 were measured in testicular tissue. Histological examination was performed to assess spermatogenesis. Protein levels of Notch 2, Jagged 1, and hairy/enhancer of split 1 (hes-1) was quantified. The degree of testicular oxidative stress, DNA damage and germ cell apoptosis were also evaluated. T I/R induced severe tubular damage, a significant increase in MMP- 2 and MMP-9 expression and decreased expression TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. Genistein treatment normalized the MMP-TIMP imbalance. Rats subjected to t I/R had low total antioxidant capacity of the testis, decreased superoxide dismutase activity, and increased oxidative DNA damage. Enhanced activities of caspase 8, caspase 3 and PARP were also observed during t I/R. Genistein reversed the t I/R-induced suppression of the Notch 2/Jagged 1/hes-1 pathway. Genistein was also able to salvage the testicular structure and function through restoring the MMP-TIMP anti-proteolytic balance, suppressing spermatogenic damage, alleviating oxidative stress and apoptosis. The Notch pathway is partly involved in inhibiting the t I/R-induced testicular impairment.

27107962|t|Absolute quantification reveals the stable transmission of a high copy number variant linked to autoinflammatory disease.
27107962|a|BACKGROUND: Dissecting the role copy number variants (CNVs) play in disease pathogenesis is directly reliant on accurate methods for quantification. The Shar-Pei dog breed is predisposed to a complex autoinflammatory disease with numerous clinical manifestations. One such sign, recurrent fever, was previously shown to be significantly associated with a novel, but unstable CNV (CNV_16.1). Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) offers a new mechanism for CNV detection via absolute quantification with the promise of added precision and reliability. The aim of this study was to evaluate ddPCR in relation to quantitative PCR (qPCR) and to assess the suitability of the favoured method as a genetic test for Shar-Pei Autoinflammatory Disease (SPAID). RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-six individuals were assayed using both PCR methods at two CNV positions (CNV_14.3 and CNV_16.1). The digital method revealed a striking result. The CNVs did not follow a continuum of alleles as previously reported, rather the alleles were stable and pedigree analysis showed they adhered to Mendelian segregation. Subsequent analysis of ddPCR case/control data confirmed that both CNVs remained significantly associated with the subphenotype of fever, but also to the encompassing SPAID complex (p   <   0.001). In addition, harbouring CNV_16.1 allele five (CNV_16.1 5) resulted in a four-fold increase in the odds for SPAID (p   <   0.001). The inclusion of a genetic marker for CNV_16.1 in a genome-wide association test revealed that this variant explained 9.7  % of genetic variance and 25.8  % of the additive genetic heritability of this autoinflammatory disease. CONCLUSIONS: This data shows the utility of the ddPCR method to resolve cryptic copy number inheritance patterns and so open avenues of genetic testing. In its current form, the ddPCR test presented here could be used in canine breeding to reduce the number of homozygote CNV_16.1 5 individuals and thereby to reduce the prevalence of disease in this breed.

27107075|t|Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 Expression in Canine Cancer.
27107075|a|BACKGROUND: Antibody therapy targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a promising therapy in human cancer, but only limited information on PD-L1 expression in canine tumors is available. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PD-L1 expression was examined in 31 canine tumor cell lines of various origins by flow cytometry and western blotting, and in canine tumor and normal tissue specimens by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: PD-L1 was only expressed on the cell surface of a small number of cell lines but was found expressed within the cells of almost all cell lines. Immunohistochemistry revealed that PD-L1 is frequently expressed in malignant melanoma, mammary gland tumor, mast cell tumor and lymphoma, but less frequently in soft-tissue sarcoma and hemangiosarcoma. PD-L1 was also expressed in some of the cells of normal canine tissue specimens. CONCLUSION: Canine tumors with PD-L1 expression that were identified in this study are potential candidates for antiPD-1 and antiPD-L1 therapy.

27106742|t|No Evidence of Herpesvirus Infection in West Highland White Terriers With Canine Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.
27106742|a|UNASSIGNED: In humans, horses, and rodents, an association between pulmonary fibrotic disorders and gammaherpesvirus infection has been suggested. In dogs, canine idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (CIPF), a progressive fibrotic lung disease of unknown origin and poorly understood pathophysiology, has been reported to occur in West Highland white terriers (WHWTs). The present study investigated the potential association between CIPF and herpesvirus infection. A PCR assay, using a mixture of degenerate and deoxyinosine-substituted primers targeting highly conserved regions of the DNA polymerase gene (DPOL) of herpesviruses, was applied on both lung and blood samples from WHWTs affected with CIPF and controls. Herpesvirus DPOL sequence could not be amplified from any of 46 lung samples (28 affected WHWTs and 18 control dogs of various breeds) and 38 blood samples (19 CIPF WHWTs and 19 control age-matched WHWTs) included. An association between CIPF and herpesvirus infection is therefore unlikely. Investigation of other causes of the disease is warranted.

27106740|t|Immunosuppression in Dogs During Mammary Cancer Development.
27106740|a|UNASSIGNED: Cancer immunosuppression that facilitates tumor progression and metastasis evolves by development of an immunosuppressive network. The aim of this study was to assess this network in dogs with benign or malignant tumors with or without confirmed metastasis. The authors showed that the number of various T cell subpopulations was constant during tumor development; however the number of regulatory T cells (Tregs) was significantly higher in tumor-bearing dogs than in healthy individuals. The number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and their p-STAT3 expression (which is a negative regulator of hematopoiesis and regulates VEGF expression) were higher in cancer patients than in control dogs, however their number increased significantly in late-stage cancer patients. Canine mammary carcinomas with confirmed metastases to either lymph nodes or internal organs had greater MDSCs and Treg infiltration than benign mammary tumors or malignant mammary tumors for which metastases had not been detected. Similarly, expression of p-STAT3 and VEGF-C was the highest in tumors with confirmed metastases. This research shows changes occurring in the blood (n = 30 patients) and tumor tissue of patients (n = 100) during canine mammary tumor development. The findings should be considered preliminary because of the small number of samples. Nonetheless, the findings suggest that a high level of Tregs and MDSCs as well as high expression of p-STAT3 and VEGF-C may significantly contribute to mammary tumor progression and metastasis in dogs.

27042428|t|Nutrition and Osteoporosis: Preliminary data of Campania Region of European PERsonalised ICT Supported Service for Independent Living and Active Ageing.
27042428|a|BACKGROUND: Bone impairment and malnutrition are associated with significant disability and mortality. PERSSILAA is an European project developing health services to detect and prevent frailty in older adults by addressing cognitive, physical and nutritional. METHODS: Subjects underwent anthropometric measurements, calcaneal quantitative ultrasound (QUS) scan and PREDIMED (PREvenci  n con DIeta MEDiterr  nea) questionnaire. AIM: To investigate the association between adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MD) and bone health. RESULTS: 87 subjects (4 males and 83 females) 70.1  4.9 aged, were examined. Mean Body Mass Index (BMI) was 28.7  4.7(kg/m(2)): in particular 28 subjects (32.2%) resulted obese, 42 (48.3%) overweight, and only 17 (19.5%) with normal weight. Mean T score was -1.2  1.2: in particular 13 subjects (14.9%) resulted osteoporotic; 43 (49.5%) osteopenic; and 31 (35.6%) with normal bone mineral density. Regarding adherence to MD, 9 subjects (10.3%) were poorly adherent; 41 (47.2%) average adherent; 37 (42.5%) highly adherent. T-score was associated with PREDIMED score and osteoporotic subjects presented the lowest PREDIMED score (5.8  2.2). CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data show a significant correlation between the adherence to the MD and bone health parameters. The association between MD and bone health highlights the potential beneficial effects of nutritional interventions promoting a Mediterranean food pattern, as safe adjuvant treatment in ageing.

27168551|t|Simple and Procedural Reaction Time for Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in a Hyperbaric Oxygen Clinical Trial.
27168551|a|UNASSIGNED: Simple reaction time (SRT) and procedural reaction time (PRT) are speed-of-processing tasks in the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) that may be sensitive to mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). The investigators measured SRT and PRT throughput (correct responses per minute) at baseline, 6 weeks, and 13 weeks in military personnel with mTBI randomized to local care or 40 chamber sessions (sham-1.2 atmospheres absolute [ATA] air, hyperbaric oxygen-1.5 ATA O2). Scores were assessed at baseline using univariate analysis of variance and across time with repeated measures methods. Data reported as throughput standard scores (mean = 100, SD = 15). Seventy-two participants with ongoing symptoms after mTBI enrolled in the study (three female, median age 31 years, mean three lifetime concussion events, most recent mTBI 23 months prior). Sixty-four had Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics data at 13 weeks. SRT and PRT throughput standard scores were comparable across groups at baseline. Over time, SRT scores did not change in the hyperbaric oxygen or sham groups and decreased in the local care group. PRT throughput standard scores increased from baseline to mid-intervention and decreased from mid-intervention to postintervention in all groups. Repeated measures change over time in SRT (p = 0.23), and PRT (p = 0.17) scores were not different among groups. This study may be underpowered to detect statistically significant change.

27087478|t|Targeted estimation and inference for the sample average treatment effect in trials with and without pair-matching.
27087478|a|UNASSIGNED: In cluster randomized trials, the study units usually are not a simple random sample from some clearly defined target population. Instead, the target population tends to be hypothetical or ill-defined, and the selection of study units tends to be systematic, driven by logistical and practical considerations. As a result, the population average treatment effect (PATE) may be neither well defined nor easily interpretable. In contrast, the sample average treatment effect (SATE) is the mean difference in the counterfactual outcomes for the study units. The sample parameter is easily interpretable and arguably the most relevant when the study units are not sampled from some specific super-population of interest. Furthermore, in most settings, the sample parameter will be estimated more efficiently than the population parameter. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to propose using targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) for estimation and inference of the sample effect in trials with and without pair-matching. We study the asymptotic and finite sample properties of the TMLE for the sample effect and provide a conservative variance estimator. Finite sample simulations illustrate the potential gains in precision and power from selecting the sample effect as the target of inference. This work is motivated by the Sustainable East Africa Research in Community Health (SEARCH) study, a pair-matched, community randomized trial to estimate the effect of population-based HIV testing and streamlined ART on the 5-year cumulative HIV incidence (NCT01864603). The proposed methodology will be used in the primary analysis for the SEARCH trial. Copyright    2016 John Wiley _ Sons, Ltd.

27088868|t|Conformal prediction to define applicability domain - A case study on predicting ER and AR binding.
27088868|a|UNASSIGNED: A fundamental element when deriving a robust and predictive in silico model is not only the statistical quality of the model in question but, equally important, the estimate of its predictive boundaries. This work presents a new method, conformal prediction, for applicability domain estimation in the field of endocrine disruptors. The method is applied to binders and non-binders related to the oestrogen and androgen receptors. Ensembles of decision trees are used as statistical method and three different sets (dragon, rdkit and signature fingerprints) are investigated as chemical descriptors. The conformal prediction method results in valid models where there is an excellent balance in quality between the internally validated training set and the corresponding external test set, both in terms of validity and with respect to sensitivity and specificity. With this method the level of confidence can be readily altered by the user and the consequences thereof immediately inspected. Furthermore, the predictive boundaries for the derived models are rigorously defined by using the conformal prediction framework, thus no ambiguity exists as to the level of similarity needed for new compounds to be in or out of the predictive boundaries of the derived models where reliable predictions can be expected.

27080297|t|[Anterior dislocation of the fibula resulting from surgical malreduction: a case report].
27080297|a|Ankle joint fracture is one of the most common types of fracture. There are many researches on the injury mechanism, treatment principles and surgical techniques. A type of injury which combines posterior dislocation of fibula, known as the Bosworth injury, is relatively rare. In 1947, Bosworth first described this type of injury as an unusual ankle fracture dislocation with fixed posterior fracture dislocation of the distal part of the fibula. In this type of fracture, the proximal fibular shaft fragment locks behind the tibialis posterior tubercle. This rare ankle fracture variant is often not recognized in initial radiographs and requires a computed tomographic (CT) scan for verification. But there are already many reports, discussing the injury mechanism, treatment principles and surgical techniques. However, there are few reports of anterior dislocation of the fibula, caused by either injury or surgery. The mechanism of the injury is still not clear. This article reports a case of anterior dislocation of the fibula. We report a patient with left ankle open fracture (Lauge-Hansen pronation-external rotation stage III, Gustilo IIIA). Open reduction and internal fixation was done in the initial surgery, but ended up with poor reduction, resulting in fibula anterior dislocation, anterior dislocation of talus and tibia fibular dislocation. The fibula was dislocated anteriorly of the tibia, which rarely happened. The patient suffered severe ankle joint dysfunction. The second operation took out the original internal fixation, reduced the fracture, and reset the internal fixation. The function of ankle joint was improved obviously after operation. But because of the initial injury and the two operations, the soft tissue around the fracture was greatly damaged. 6 months after the second operation, and the fracture still not healed, so the bone graft was carried out in the third surgery. Two months after the third surgery, the function of the ankle was significantly better than before, but the fracture healing was poor, which needed further review. Through this case, we understand the rare type of ankle fracture with anterior dislocation of the fibula, and recognize that the timing and quality of initial surgery has a great impact on the patient's prognosis and rehabilitation period.

27128059|t|Relativistic effects in imaging of light in flight with arbitrary paths.
27128059|a|UNASSIGNED: Direct observation of light in flight is enabled by recent avalanche photodiode arrays, which have the capability for time-correlated single photon counting. In contrast to classical imaging, imaging of light in flight depends on the relative sensor position, which is studied in detail by measurement and analysis of light pulses propagating at different angles. The time differences of arrival are analyzed to determine the propagation angle and distance of arbitrary light paths. Further analysis of the apparent velocity shows that light pulses can appear to travel at superluminal or subluminal apparent velocities.

27126126|t|Therapeutic Ultrasound and Treadmill Training Suppress Peripheral Nerve Injury Induced-Pain in Rats.
27126126|a|BACKGROUND: Although evidence suggests that therapeutic ultrasound (TU) in combination with treadmill training (TT) suppresses nerve injury-associated pain, the molecular mechanisms for this action are not clear. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this research was to study the possible beneficial effects of TU and TT, alone and in combination, on two clinical indicators of neuropathic pain and to correlate these findings with changes in inflammatory mediators within the spinal cord. Our experimental model used the well-known chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the rat sciatic nerve. DESIGN: An experimental study. METHODS: Each group contained 10 rats. Group 1 underwent only the CCI procedure. Group 2 underwent a sham-operation where the sciatic nerve was exposed but not ligated. Group 3 had the sham-operation followed by both TT and TU. Groups 4, 5, and 6 underwent the CCI procedure followed by TT alone, TU alone, and both the TT and TU interventions, respectively. Heat and mechanical sensitivity, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (iba-1) were evaluated. RESULTS: Compared to Group 1 animals, TT and/or TU produced smaller decreases in mechanical withdrawal threshold and heat withdrawal latencies. The combination of TT and TU was more effective than either treatment alone. In addition, rats who received these treatments did not express the upregulation of IL-6 and iba-1 in their spinal cords on postoperative days 14 and 28, as was found in the Group 1 animals. LIMITATIONS: These experimental findings may not be generalizable to humans. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of TU + TT reduces neuropathic pain more than either modality alone. This beneficial effect appears related to down-regulation of pro-inflammatory IL-6 and iba-1, while up-regulating the anti-inflammatory IL-10.

27127920|t|Faecal bacterial composition in dairy cows shedding Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis in faeces in comparison with nonshedding cows.
27127920|a|UNASSIGNED: The aim of this study was to determine possible differences in the faecal microbiota of dairy cows infected with Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Johne's disease) in comparison with noninfected cows from the same herds. Faecal samples from cows in 4 herds were tested for M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis by real-time PCR, and faecal bacterial populations were analysed by 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The most notable differences between shedding and nonshedding cows were an increase in the genus Psychrobacter and a decrease in the genera Oscillospira, Ruminococcus, and Bifidobacterium in cows infected with M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. The present study is the first to report the faecal microbial composition in dairy cows infected with M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis.

27159196|t|Noninvasive ventilation versus oxygen therapy for the treatment of acute respiratory failure.
27159196|a|INTRODUCTION: there is an ongoing discussion on whether oxygen therapy or noninvasive ventilation (NIV) should be used in patient with acute respiratory failure. While respiratory acidosis, especially in case of COPD exacerbation, is a clear indication for NIV, data available in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) are ambiguous. In addition, recently the use of nasal high flow (NHF) has been increased. Despite that NHF has been studied as an alternative to NIV, the clinical advantages of NHF need to be confirmed. Areas covered: the purpose of this review is to enhance our understanding about the management of AHRF in specific settings, focusing on recent papers in which NIV and standard oxygen or NHF have been compared. Expert Commentary: the choice of the most appropriate strategy for AHRF treatment should be made based upon patient's clinical status, underlying diseases, level of required respiratory support and patient's tolerance and comfort.

27159636|t|Pseudomonas toxin pyocyanin triggers autophagy: Implications for pathoadaptive mutations.
27159636|a|UNASSIGNED: Pseudomonas aeruginosa can establish life-long chronic infection in patients with cystic fibrosis by generating genetic loss-of-function mutations, which enhance fitness of the bacterium in the airways. However, the precise role of the pathoadaptive mutations in persistence in chronic airways infection remains largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that pyocyanin, a well-described P. aeruginosa virulence factor that plays an important role in the initial infection, promotes autophagy in bronchial epithelial cells. Disruption of phzM, which is required for pyocyanin biosynthesis, leads to a significant reduction in autophagy in Beas-2B cells and lung tissues. Pyocyanin-induced autophagy is mediated by the EIF2AK4/GCN2-EIF2S1/eIF2a-ATF4 pathway. Interestingly, rats infected with the phzM   mutant strain have high mortality rate and numbers of colony-forming units, compared to those infected with wild-type (WT) P. aeruginosa PA14 strain, during chronic P. aeruginosa infection. In addition, the phzM   mutant strain induces more extensive alveolar wall thickening than the WT strain in the pulmonary airways of rats. As autophagy plays an essential role in suppressing bacterial burden, our findings provide a detailed understanding of why reduction of pyocyanin production in P. aeruginosa in chronic airways infections has been associated with better host adaptation and worse outcomes in cystic fibrosis.

27064171|t|Quantitative proteomic profiling of peanut allergens in food ingredients used for oral food challenges.
27064171|a|UNASSIGNED: Profiling allergens in complex food ingredients used in oral food challenges and immunotherapy is crucial for regulatory acceptance. Mass spectrometry based analysis employing data independent acquisition coupled with ion mobility mass spec-trometry-mass spectrometry (DIA-IM-MS) was used to investigate the allergen composition of raw peanuts and roasted peanut flour ingredients used in challenge meals. This comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analysis using label-free approaches identified and quantified 123 unique protein accessions. Semi-quantitative analysis indicated that allergens Ara h 1 and Ara h 3 were the most abundant proteins and present in approximately equal amounts, and were extracted in reduced amounts from roasted peanut flours. The clinically significant allergens Ara h 2 and 6 were less abundant but relative quantification was unaffected by roasting. Ara h 5 was undetectable in any peanut sample, whilst the Bet v 1 homologue Ara h 8 and the lipid transfer protein aller-gen, Ara h 9, were detected in low abundance. The oleosin allergens, Ara h 10 and 11 were moderately abundant in the raw peanuts but were 100-fold less abundant in the defatted roasted peanut flour than the major allergens Ara h 1, 3, 2 and 6. Certain isoforms of the major allergens dominated the profile. The relative quantitation of the major peanut allergens showed little variation between different batches of roasted peanut flour. These data will support future development of targeted approaches for absolute quantifica-tion of peanut allergens which can be applied to both food ingredients used in clinical studies, extracts used for skin testing and to identify trace levels of allergens in foods.

27035394|t|The impact of personality on driving safety among Chinese high-speed railway drivers.
27035394|a|UNASSIGNED: This study explored the impact of personality traits on driving safety in high-speed railway drivers. A sample of high-speed railway drivers in Beijing (N=214) completed a questionnaire, including information on personality traits and background variables. The NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) was administered to characterize participants based on five personality traits: Neuroticism, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Openness to Experience, and Conscientiousness. The survey data were combined with naturalistic data of accident involvement and risky driving behavior in China. Poisson regression results show that drivers with high Conscientiousness and Extraversion caused fewer accidents. Higher Conscientiousness and lower Agreeableness were related to less frequent risky driving behavior. Education level and age negatively moderated the relation between certain personality traits and driving safety. The findings suggest that personality traits should be considered when selecting and training high-speed railway drivers.

27036311|t|Directed differentiation of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons from human pluripotent stem cells.
27036311|a|BACKGROUND: Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) play critical roles in learning, memory and cognition. Dysfunction or degeneration of BFCNs may connect to neuropathology, such as Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome and dementia. Generation of functional BFCNs may contribute to the studies of cell-based therapy and pathogenesis that is related to learning and memory deficits. NEW METHOD: Here we describe a detail method for robust generation of BFCNs from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). In this method, BFCN progenitors are patterned from hESC or hiPSC-derived primitive neuroepithelial cells, with the treatment of sonic hedgehog (SHH) or combination with its agonist Purmorphamine, and by co-culturing with human astrocytes. RESULTS: At day 20,    90% hPSC-derived progenitors expressed NKX2.1, which is a transcriptional marker for MGE. Moreover, around 40% of NKX2.1+ cells co-expressed OLIG2 and    15% of NKX2.1+ cells co-expressed ISLET1, which are ventral markers. At day 35,    40% neurons robustly express ChAT, most of which are co-labeled with NKX2.1, ISLET1 and FOXG1, indicating the basal forebrain-like identity. At day 45, these neurons express mature neuronal markers MAP2, Synapsin, and VAChT. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): In this method, undefined conditions including genetic modification or cell-sorting are avoided. As a choice, feeder free conditions are used to avoid ingredients of animal origin. Moreover, Purmorphamine can be substituted for SHH to induce ventral progenitors effectively and economically. CONCLUSION: We provide an efficient method to generate BFCNs from multiple hPSC lines, which offers the potential application for disease modeling and pharmacological studies.

27015514|t|Congestion Induced by the Structure of Multiplex Networks.
27015514|a|UNASSIGNED: Multiplex networks are representations of multilayer interconnected complex networks where the nodes are the same at every layer. They turn out to be good abstractions of the intricate connectivity of multimodal transportation networks, among other types of complex systems. One of the most important critical phenomena arising in such networks is the emergence of congestion in transportation flows. Here, we prove analytically that the structure of multiplex networks can induce congestion for flows that otherwise would be decongested if the individual layers were not interconnected. We provide explicit equations for the onset of congestion and approximations that allow us to compute this onset from individual descriptors of the individual layers. The observed cooperative phenomenon is reminiscent of Braess' paradox in which adding extra capacity to a network when the moving entities selfishly choose their route can in some cases reduce overall performance. Similarly, in the multiplex structure, the efficiency in transportation can unbalance the transportation loads resulting in unexpected congestion.

27014480|t|Hybrid theatre and alternative localization techniques in conventional and single-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.
27014480|a|Management of pulmonary nodules in terms of diagnosis and intraoperative localization can be challenging, especially in the minimal invasive video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) approach, and may be even more difficult with single port VATS with limited access. The ability to localize small lesions intraoperatively is particularly important for excisional biopsy for diagnostic frozen section, as well as to guide sublobar resection. Some of the common techniques to aid localization include preoperative percutaneous hookwire localization, colour dye or radio-dye labelling injection of the nodule or adjacent site to allowing visualization or detection by radioactive counter intraoperatively. The use of hybrid operating room (OR) for intraoperative localization of lung nodules was first reported in 2013, and was called image guided VATS (iVATS). Subsequently, we have expanded the iVATS application for single port VATS major lung resection of small or ground-glass opacity lesions. By performing an on-table cone-beam CT scan, real-time and accurate assessment of the pulmonary lesion can be made, which can aid the localization process. Other types of physical or colour marker that can be deployed percutaneously in the hybrid OR immediate before surgery can enhance haptic feedback and sensitivity of digital palpation, as well as provide a radiopaque nidus for radiological confirmation. In the past decade, the electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) technology had developed into a useful adjunct technology for the localization of peripheral lung nodules by injection of marking agent or deployment of fiducial to the lesion through the endobronchial route causing much lower marking agent diffusion and artefacts. Recently, the combination of hybrid OR and ENB for lung nodule localization and marking has further increased the accuracy and applicability of the technology. The article will be exploring the latest development of the above approaches to lung nodule localization, and discuss some of the techniques' advantages and flaws.

27104764|t|Cigarette Smoke-Induced Lung Disease Predisposes to More Severe Infection with Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae: Protective Effects of Andrographolide.
27104764|a|UNASSIGNED: Cigarette smoke (CS) is associated with many maladies, one of which is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As the disease progresses, patients are more prone to develop COPD exacerbation episodes by bacterial infection, particularly to nontypeable Haemophilus influenza (NTHi) infection. The present study aimed to develop a CS-exposed mouse model that increases inflammation induced by NTHi challenge and investigate the protective effects of andrographolide, a bioactive molecule with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties isolated from the plant Andrographis paniculata. Female BALB/c mice exposed to 2 weeks of CS followed by a single intratracheal instillation of NTHi developed increased macrophage and neutrophil pulmonary infiltration, augmented cytokine levels, and heightened oxidative damage. Andrographolide effectively reduced lung cellular infiltrates and decreased lung levels of TNF-a, IL-1b, CXCL1/KC, 8-OHdG, matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8), and MMP-9. The protective actions of andrographolide on CS-predisposed NTHi inflammation might be attributable to increased nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activation and decreased Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) repressor function, resulting in enhanced gene expression of antioxidant enzymes including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase-2 (GPx-2), glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier (GCLM), and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). Taken together, these findings strongly support a therapeutic potential for andrographolide in preventing lung inflammation caused by NTHi in cigarette smokers.

27168244|t|Protein Kinase C Enzymes in the Hematopoietic and Immune Systems.
27168244|a|UNASSIGNED: The protein kinase C (PKC) family, discovered in the late 1970s, is composed of at least 10 serine/threonine kinases, divided into three groups based on their molecular architecture and cofactor requirements. PKC enzymes have been conserved throughout evolution and are expressed in virtually all cell types; they represent critical signal transducers regulating cell activation, differentiation, proliferation, death, and effector functions. PKC family members play important roles in a diverse array of hematopoietic and immune responses. This review covers the discovery and history of this enzyme family, discusses the roles of PKC enzymes in the development and effector functions of major hematopoietic and immune cell types, and points out gaps in our knowledge, which should ignite interest and further exploration, ultimately leading to better understanding of this enzyme family and, above all, its role in the many facets of the immune system.

27166452|t|[Dental treatment under general anaesthesia in young children].
27166452|a|General anaesthesia in children younger than 4 years of age can cause brain damage with cognitive and behavioral problems as a result. The chance of these side effects is small, but increases with prolonged duration of the anaesthesia or when the general anaesthesia is provided more frequently. It  goes without saying that the indication for anaesthesia should be very strictly set. In order to reduce the chance of damage, the anaesthesia itself should be performed in consultation between the anaesthesiologist and care provider, according to a set protocol. The parents need to be informed of the potential risks of general anaesthesia. Delayed treatment (and thereby provision of the anaesthesia) should be considered.

27019545|t|Potent P2X7 Receptor Antagonists: Tyrosyl Derivatives Synthesized Using a Sequential Parallel Synthetic Approach.
27019545|a|UNASSIGNED: Novel analogs of 1-(N,O-bis[5-isoquinolinesulfonyl]-N-methyl-L-tyrosyl)-4-phenylpiperazine (KN-62,1) were synthesized and found to be potent antagonists in a functional assay, inhibition of ATP-induced K(+) efflux in HEK293 cells expressing recombinant human P2X7 receptors. Antagonism of murine P2X7 receptors was also observed. The analogs consisted of L-tyrosine derivatives, of the general structure R1-Tyr(OR2)-piperazinyl-R3, in which three positions were systematically varied in structure through facile acylation reactions. Each of the three positions was optimized in sequence through parallel synthesis alternating with biological evaluation, leading to the identification and optimization of potent P2X7 antagonists. The optimal groups at R1 were found to be large hydrophobic groups, linked to the a-amino position through carbamate, amide, or sulfonamide groups. The benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group was preferred over most sulfonamides and other acyl groups examined, except for quinoline sulfonyl. At R2, an arylsulfonate ester was preferred, and the order of potency was p-tolyl, p-methoxyphenyl, phenyl > a-naphthyl, b-naphthyl. A benzoyl ester was of intermediate potency. Aliphatic esters and carbonate derivatives at the tyrosyl phenol were inactive, while a tyrosyl O-benzyl ether was relatively potent. The most potent P2X7 receptor antagonists identified in this study contained Cbz at the R1 position, an aryl sulfonate at the R2 position, and various acyl groups at the R3 position. At R3, t-butyloxycarbonyl- and benzoyl groups were preferred. The opening of the piperazinyl ring to an ethylene diamine moiety abolished antagonism. In concentration-response studies, a di-isoquinolinyl, Boc derivative, 4 (MRS2306), displayed an IC50 value of 40 nM as an antagonist of P2X7 receptor-mediated ion flux and was more potent than the reference compound 1. N(a)-Cbz, Boc-piperazinyl derivatives, 11 (MRS2317), 22 (MRS2326), and 41 (MRS2409) were less potent than 1, with IC50 values of 200-300 nM.

27105538|t|Induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone in stage III-IVb nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients with Epstein-Barr virus DNA >= 4000 copies/ml: a matched study.
27105538|a|BACKGROUND: The effects of induction chemotherapy (IC) followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in high-risk (stage III-IVb with EBV DNA>= 4000 copies/ml) nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients are unclear. METHODS: A total of 325 high-risk NPC patients treated with IC+CCRT or CCRT alone who were treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) between March 2007 and March 2013 were included. For each patient in the IC+CCRT group, a matched pair in the CCRT group was matching for: gender, age, T stage, N stage, clinical stage and WHO (World Health Organization) type. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and locoregional relapse-free survival (LRFS). RESULTS: There were no significant differences in OS, PFS, DMFS, and LRFS between the IC+CCRT (148 patients) and CCRT (177 patients) groups. After matching, 103 paired patients were analyzed, and there were no differences between the IC+CCRT and CCRT groups regarding clinical outcomes. Based on the subgroup analysis of 156 very-high-risk patients (stage N2-3 with EBV DNA >= 4000 copies/ml), the 5-year OS of the IC+CCRT and CCRT groups was 84.3% and 67.5% (P =0.033), respectively. Based on our multivariate analysis, the treatment group was significantly associated with OS (P=0.034; HR0.451, 95%CI 0.216-0.941). CONCLUSIONS: IC+CCRT did not improve the clinical outcomes of high-risk NPC patients compared to CCRT alone. However, in very-high-risk patients, IC+CCRT treatment led to increased OS compared to patients received CCRT treatment alone.

27008334|t|Effect of Perflubron-induced lung growth on pulmonary vascular remodeling in congenital diaphragmatic hernia.
27008334|a|PURPOSE: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) involves lung hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension (PH). Post-natal Perflubron ventilation induces lung growth. This phenomenon is called Perflubon-induced lung growth (PILG). However, it does not appear to ameliorate PH in CDH. We aim to determine the effect of PILG on pulmonary vascular remodeling in neonates with CDH and PH requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). METHODS: Lung tissue from four patients was obtained, three treated with PILG  +  ECMO, and one maintained on conventional ventilation  +  ECMO (control). The distribution of collagen was assessed with Masson's trichrome stain. Immunohistochemistry was done to assess cell proliferation and immunofluorescence to assess vascular morphology. RESULTS: Comparing PILG vs. control, there was an increase in vessel wall diameter (6.85   m, 10.28   m, and 10.35   m vs. 4.34   m), increase in collagen thickness in two PILG patients (35.66   m, 14.23   m, and 38.46   m vs. 22.16   m), and decrease in lumen diameter despite similar total area (48.99   m, 41.74   m, and 36.32   m vs. 51.56   m) for each PILG patient vs. the control patient, respectively. CONCLUSION: PILG does not appear to improve pulmonary vascular remodeling that occurs with PH. The findings are descriptive and will require larger samples to validate the significance of the findings. Overall, further studies will be required to identify the mechanistic causes of PH in CDH to create effective treatments.

27004401|t|Protein Phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2+-dependent 1A controls the innate antiviral and antibacterial response of macrophages during HIV-1 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.
27004401|a|UNASSIGNED: Co-infection with HIV-1 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a major public health issue. While some research has described how each pathogen accelerates the course of infection of the other pathogen by compromising the immune system, very little is known about the molecular biology of HIV-1/Mtb co-infection at the host cell level. This is somewhat surprising, as both pathogens are known to replicate and persist in macrophages. We here identify Protein Phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2+-dependent 1A (PPM1A) as a molecular link between Mtb infection and increased HIV-1 susceptibility of macrophages. We demonstrate that both Mtb and HIV-1 infection induce the expression of PPM1A in primary human monocyte/macrophages and THP-1 cells. Genetic manipulation studies revealed that increased PPMA1 expression rendered THP-1 cells highly susceptible to HIV-1 infection, while depletion of PPM1A rendered them relatively resistant to HIV-1 infection. At the same time, increased PPM1A expression abrogated the ability of THP-1 cells to respond to relevant bacterial stimuli with a proper cytokine/chemokine secretion response, blocked their chemotactic response and impaired their ability to phagocytose bacteria. These data suggest that PPM1A, which had previously been shown to play a role in the antiviral response to Herpes Simplex virus infection, also governs the antibacterial response of macrophages to bacteria, or at least to Mtb infection. PPM1A thus seems to play a central role in the innate immune response of macrophages, implying that host directed therapies targeting PPM1A could be highly beneficial, in particular for HIV/Mtb co-infected patients.

27000456|t|Genetic diversity in Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates from patients with invasive and noninvasive infections in a Japanese university hospital (2014-2015).
27000456|a|UNASSIGNED: Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (SDSE) isolates with b-hemolysis and carbohydrate groups G/C are recovered increasingly from invasive infections in Japan. The aim of this study was to determine epidemiological characteristics of SDSE isolates circulating locally among patients with invasive and noninvasive infections. We selected groups G/C b-hemolytic streptococci from a database at the Clinical Laboratory of Kitasato University Medical Center from May 2014 through April 2015. Thirteen isolates were identified as SDSE based on the data from API-20 Strep and 16S rRNA sequencing. The samples were from seven sterile specimens (blood) and six non-sterile specimens (pus/sputum/vaginal secretion). Information about the patients with invasive or noninvasive SDSE infections was retrieved from their medical charts. We performed emm genotyping, multilocus sequence typing, dendrogram analysis of the samples using pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and amplifications of streptococcal inhibitor of a complement-mediated cell lysis-like gene (sicG)/ antimicrobial resistance determinants. We identified eight different emm genotypes, eight different sequence types including four novel types, nine different groups in the PFGE dendrogram, presence or absence of sicG, and four different resistance genotypes. Our observations suggest genetic diversity in SDSE isolates from patients with invasive and noninvasive infections in a Japanese university hospital (2014-2015).

27005520|t|Using CART to Identify Thresholds and Hierarchies in the Determinants of Funding Decisions.
27005520|a|UNASSIGNED: There is much interest in understanding decision-making processes that determine funding outcomes for health interventions. We use classification and regression trees (CART) to identify cost-effectiveness thresholds and hierarchies in the determinants of funding decisions. The hierarchical structure of CART is suited to analyzing complex conditional and nonlinear relationships. Our analysis uncovered hierarchies where interventions were grouped according to their type and objective. Cost-effectiveness thresholds varied markedly depending on which group the intervention belonged to: lifestyle-type interventions with a prevention objective had an incremental cost-effectiveness threshold of  2356, suggesting that such interventions need to be close to cost saving or dominant to be funded. For lifestyle-type interventions with a treatment objective, the threshold was much higher at  37,024. Lower down the tree, intervention attributes such as the level of patient contribution and the eligibility for government reimbursement influenced the likelihood of funding within groups of similar interventions. Comparison between our CART models and previously published results demonstrated concurrence with standard regression techniques while providing additional insights regarding the role of the funding environment and the structure of decision-maker preferences.

27140176|t|Interobserver Variation Among Pathologists in Evaluating Perineural Invasion for Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.
27140176|a|UNASSIGNED: The aims of this study are as follows: (1) to assess variations among pathologists in evaluating perineural invasion (PNI) in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), (2) to survey PNI criteria used by pathologists and how they came to adopt those criteria. An electronic survey was sent to 363 oral and/or surgical pathologists. Eligibility criteria included pathology board certification. The survey participants were asked to rate whether PNI was present, absent, or uncertain for 15 provided photomicrographs, which depicted various types of tumor-nerve relationships without excessive desmoplasia or lymphocytic host response. The survey obtained information regarding demographics, whether PNI criteria were taught during residency, criteria used by participants to evaluate PNI, how the participants developed their criteria, and agreement with six proposed PNI definitions. 88 pathologists completed the survey. The participants included 47 males and 41 females, with average age  =  49  years and average practice experience  =  17  years. Practice settings included dental school (40  %), medical school (36  %), private pathology lab (13  %), and other (11  %). Agreement between participants in rating PNI status for the provided images was fair (k  =  .38, 95  % CI .37-.39). 56  % of respondents indicated that they were taught PNI criteria during residency training. The basis for criteria currently used by participants included residency training (n  =  42), published literature (n  =  29), and own experience/views (n  =  32). Agreement regarding six proposed PNI definitions was slight (k  =  .10, 95  % CI .08-.11). In conclusion, interobserver agreement in assessing PNI status was fair. Our results suggest that more widely accepted, objective, and reproducible criteria are needed for evaluating PNI in OSCC.

27113200|t|NTAK/neuregulin-2 secreted by astrocytes promotes survival and neurite outgrowth of neurons via ErbB3.
27113200|a|UNASSIGNED: NTAK (neural- and thymus-derived activator for ErbB kinases), also known as neuregulin-2 (NRG2), is a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, which binds directly to ErbB3 and ErbB4, and transactivates ErbB2. NTAK/NRG2 is structurally homologous to NRG1. The biological function of NTAK/NRG2 still remains unknown, especially in the nervous system, whereas NRG1 is known to be essential for nervous system function. In the present study, we examined the functions of NTAK/NRG2 secreted from astrocytes to neurons. NTAK/NRG2 was expressed in both neurons and astrocytes, as evidenced by immunohistochemical staining and RT-PCR methods. The conditioned medium (CM) from astrocytes promoted survival and neurite outgrowth of neurons. The CM stimulated phosphorylation of ErbB3 in neurons. When phosphorylation of ErbB3 was blocked by AZD8931, an ErbB3 inhibitor, neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth were reduced. Conversely, canertinib, an ErbB4 inhibitor, did not affect survival or neurite outgrowth of neurons. Survival and neurite outgrowth of neurons were lower in CM of NTAK/NRG2-knockdown astrocytes than in the CM of control astrocytes, whereas the CM of NRG1-knockdown astrocytes had little effect on survival and neurite outgrowth. The present study demonstrated that NTAK/NRG2 secreted from astrocytes bound to ErbB3 on neurons, and promoted neuronal survival and neurite extension in vitro.

27136701|t|Aortic surgery in Marfan patient with severe pectus excavatum.
27136701|a|AIMS: The optimal surgical management of the aortic root phenotype Marfan patients with severe pectus excavatum is a subject of debate. All the available literature were reviewed according to preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) principles in order to assess the early outcomes of both pectus excavatum and aortic repair techniques. METHODS: Searches were done in PubMed and MEDLINE electronic databases dating from July 1953 to December 2015. RESULTS: A total of 97 peer-reviewed publications were retrieved, and 27 relevant publications were identified with a total of 39 Marfan patients with pectus excavatum who underwent ascending aorta and aortic root surgery. Emergency acute Type-A aortic dissection repair was reported in five cases. Concomitant pectus excavatum and aortic root repair and composite graft implantation were the most commonly performed procedures. Complications after a staged or a combined approach were uncommon and no deaths occurred. CONCLUSION: Aortic surgery in Marfan patients with pectus excavatum was carried out according to a variety of strategies, surgical techniques and accesses with low complications rate and no mortality. Many of these were well tolerated with minimal complications and no mortality.

27054681|t|Resistance Training with Instability for Patients with Parkinson's Disease.
27054681|a|PURPOSE: This randomized controlled trial compared the effects of resistance training (RT) and RT with instability (RTI) on the timed up and go test (TUG), on-medication Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor subscale score (UPDRS-III), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) score, and muscle strength in the leg-press exercise (one repetition maximum [1RM]) of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with moderate to severe PD were randomly assigned to a non-exercising control group (C), RT group, and RTI group. The RT and RTI groups performed progressive resistance training twice a week for 12 weeks. However, only the RTI group used high motor complexity exercises (i.e., progressive resistance training with unstable devices), for example, half-squat exercise on the BOSU   device. The primary outcome was mobility (TUG). Secondary outcomes were on-medication motor signs (UPDRS-III), cognitive impairment (MoCA), quality of life (PDQ-39), and muscle strength (1RM). RESULTS: There were no differences between RTI and RT groups for any of the outcomes at post-training (P>0.05). However, there were differences between RTI and C groups in the TUG, MoCa, and muscle strength values at post-training (P<0.05). Only the RTI group improved the TUG (-1.9 seconds), UPDRS-III score (-4.5 score), MoCA score (6.0 score), and PDQ-39 score (-5.2 score) from pre to post-training (P<0.001). Muscle strength improved for both training groups (P<0.001). No adverse events were reported during the trial. CONCLUSIONS: Both training protocols improved muscle strength, but only RTI improved the mobility, motor signs, cognitive impairment, and quality of life, likely due to the usage of high motor complexity exercises. Thus, RTI may be recommended as an innovative adjunct therapeutic intervention for patients with PD.

27096088|t|Improving the uptake and comprehensiveness of bedside cognitive testing amongst liaison psychiatrists over an eight-month period.
27096088|a|The aim of this quality improvement (QI) project was to improve the uptake and comprehensiveness of bedside cognitive testing amongst liaison psychiatrists over an eight month period. The baseline measurement involved an audit of the practice of the neuropsychiatry liaison team over six months at the 840 bed St Thomas's Hospital in London, UK. Of 35 referrals, 21 patients were able, and suitable, for cognitive testing based on the referral data and clinical interview. Fourteen (66.6%) of these patients had an Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE), while 5 (23.8%) had frontal testing. The frontal tests performed were variable and inconsistent. Two Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles were then conducted. Clear guidance was issued to the team on the use of the ACE or Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in suitable patients, and how these can be supplemented by frontal testing. Given the inconsistency in the types and combination of frontal tests being conducted at baseline, a frontal lobe test sheet containing established tests was developed and implemented. In PDSA cycle 1, 100% (n=10) of able and suitable referrals had an ACE or MoCA while 100% had frontal testing (80% of these using the dedicated test sheet). In PDSA cycle 2, improvements were broadly maintained with 85.7% (n=6) of referrals having an ACE/MoCA and 85.7% having frontal testing (83.3% of these using the dedicated frontal test sheet). In conclusion, our team improved the uptake and comprehensiveness of bedside cognitive testing by changing existing practice with clear protocols regarding the use of the ACE/MoCA and the implementation of a frontal test sheet.

27033164|t|Essential role of Ufm1 conjugation in the hematopoietic system.
27033164|a|UNASSIGNED: Protein modification by ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin-like (Ubl) proteins plays a pivotal role in a wide range of cellular functions and signaling pathways. The Ufm1 conjugation system is a novel ubiquitin-like system that consists of Ufm1, Uba5 (E1), Ufc1 (E2), and less defined E3 ligase(s) and targets. Despite its discovery more than a decade ago, its biological functions and working mechanism remains poorly understood. Recent genetic studies using knockout mouse models provide unambiguous evidence for the indispensable role of the Ufm1 system in animal development and hematopoiesis, especially erythroid development. In this short review, we summarize the recent progress on this important protein modification system and highlight potential challenges ahead. Further elucidation of the function and working mechanism of the ufmylation pathway would provide insight into disease pathogenesis and novel therapeutic targets for blood-related diseases such as anemia.

27165004|t|22 Years of predictive testing for Huntington's disease: the experience of the UK Huntington's Prediction Consortium.
27165004|a|UNASSIGNED: Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition. At-risk individuals have accessed predictive testing via direct mutation testing since 1993. The UK Huntington's Prediction Consortium has collected anonymised data on UK predictive tests, annually, from 1993 to 2014: 9407 predictive tests were performed across 23 UK centres. Where gender was recorded, 4077 participants were male (44.3%) and 5122 were female (55.7%). The median age of participants was 37 years. The most common reason for predictive testing was to reduce uncertainty (70.5%). Of the 8441 predictive tests on individuals at 50% prior risk, 4629 (54.8%) were reported as mutation negative and 3790 (44.9%) were mutation positive, with 22 (0.3%) in the database being uninterpretable. Using a prevalence figure of 12.3 * 10(-5), the cumulative uptake of predictive testing in the 50% at-risk UK population from 1994 to 2014 was estimated at 17.4% (95% CI: 16.9-18.0%). We present the largest study conducted on predictive testing in HD. Our findings indicate that the vast majority of individuals at risk of HD (>80%) have not undergone predictive testing. Future therapies in HD will likely target presymptomatic individuals; therefore, identifying the at-risk population whose gene status is unknown is of significant public health value.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 11 May 2016; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2016.36.

27167300|t|Solid-Phase Synthesis and Characterization of N-Terminally Elongated Ab-3-x -Peptides.
27167300|a|UNASSIGNED: In addition to the prototypic amyloid-b (Ab) peptides Ab1-40 and Ab1-42 , several Ab variants differing in their amino and carboxy termini have been described. Synthetic availability of an Ab variant is often the key to study its role under physiological or pathological conditions. Herein, we report a protocol for the efficient solid-phase peptide synthesis of the N-terminally elongated Ab-peptides Ab-3-38 , Ab-3-40 , and Ab-3-42 . Biophysical characterization by NMR spectroscopy, CD spectroscopy, an aggregation assay, and electron microscopy revealed that all three peptides were prone to aggregation into amyloid fibrils. Immunoprecipitation, followed by mass spectrometry, indicated that Ab-3-38 and Ab-3-40 are generated by transfected cells even in the presence of a tripartite b-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme   1 (BACE1) inhibitor. The elongated Ab peptides starting at Val(-3) can be separated from N-terminally-truncated Ab forms by high-resolution isoelectric-focusing techniques, despite virtually identical isoelectric points. The synthetic Ab variants and the methods presented here are providing tools to advance our understanding of the potential roles of N-terminally elongated Ab variants in Alzheimer's disease.

27083954|t|Trajectory subtypes after injury and patient-centered outcomes.
27083954|a|BACKGROUND: The recent focus on patient-centered outcomes highlights the need to better describe recovery trajectories after injury. The purpose of this study was to characterize recovery trajectory subtypes that exist after non-neurologic injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, observational cohort of 500 adults with an Injury Severity Score > 10 but without traumatic brain or spinal cord injury from 2009 to 2011 was formed. The Short Form-36 was administered at admission and repeated at 1, 2, 4, and 12  mo after injury. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to determine the number and shape of physical composite score (PCS) and mental composite score (MCS) trajectories. RESULTS: Three PCS trajectories and five MCS trajectories were identified. For PCS, trajectory 1 (10.4%) has low baseline scores, followed by no improvement over time. Trajectory 2 (65.6%) declines 1  mo after injury then improves over time. Trajectory 3 (24.1%) has a sharp decline followed by rapid recovery. For MCS, trajectory 1 (9.4%) is low at baseline and remains low. Trajectory 2 (14.4%) has a large decrease after injury and does not recover over the next 12  mo. Trajectory 3 (22.7%) has an initial decrease in MCS early, followed by continuous recovery. Trajectory 4 (19.1%) has a steady decline over the study period. Trajectory 5 (34.3%) stays consistently high at all time points. CONCLUSIONS: Recovery after injury is complex and results in multiple recovery trajectories. This has implications for patient-centered clinical trial design and in development of patient-specific interventions to improve outcomes.

Furthermore, decarboxylative coupling of N-protected dipeptide active ester with diphenyl diselenide provided the corresponding selenodipeptide. The simple protocol, mild reaction conditions, high efficiency, and chiral keeping of this method make it an important strategy for the synthesis of chiral molecules.

27015401|t|Analysis of the surgical benefits of 5-ALA-induced fluorescence in intracranial meningiomas: experience in 204 meningiomas.
27015401|a|UNASSIGNED: OBJECTIVE One of the most important causes for recurrence of intracranial meningiomas is residual tumor tissue that remains despite assumed complete resection. Recently, intraoperative visualization of meningioma tissue by 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence was reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible surgical benefits of PpIX fluorescence for detection of meningioma tissue. METHODS 5-ALA was administered preoperatively to 190 patients undergoing resection of 204 intracranial meningiomas. The meningiomas' PpIX fluorescence status, fluorescence quality (strong or vague), and intratumoral fluorescence homogeneity were investigated during surgery. Additionally, specific sites, including the dural tail, tumor-infiltrated bone flap, adjacent cortex, and potential satellite lesions, were analyzed for PpIX fluorescence in selected cases. RESULTS PpIX fluorescence was observed in 185 (91%) of 204 meningiomas. In the subgroup of sphenoorbital meningiomas (12 of 204 cases), the dural part showed visible PpIX fluorescence in 9 cases (75%), whereas the bony part did not show any PpIX fluorescence in 10 cases (83%). Of all fluorescing meningiomas, 168 (91%) showed strong PpIX fluorescence. Typically, most meningiomas demonstrated homogeneous fluorescence (75% of cases). No PpIX fluorescence was observed in any of the investigated 89 dural tails. In contrast, satellite lesions could be identified through PpIX fluorescence in 7 cases. Furthermore, tumor-infiltrated bone flaps could be visualized by PpIX fluorescence in all 13 cases. Notably, PpIX fluorescence was also present in the adjacent cortex in 20 (25%) of 80 analyzed cases. CONCLUSIONS The authors' data from this largest patient cohort to date indicate that PpIX fluorescence enables intraoperatively visualization of most intracranial meningiomas and allows identification of residual tumor tissue at specific sites. Thus, intraoperative detection of residual meningioma tissue by PpIX fluorescence might in future reduce the risk of recurrence.

27013822|t|Eye drop administration in patients attending and not attending a glaucoma education center.
27013822|a|BACKGROUND: To assess the technique of glaucoma eye drop instillation in patients who have and have not attended glaucoma education sessions. To compare this with their subjective perception of eye drop use and identify factors associated with improved performance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An observational study of 55 participants who instill their topical glaucoma medication for more than 1 year. Twenty-five patients attended (A) glaucoma teaching sessions >1 year before the study and were compared to thirty patients who never attended (NA). Patients completed a self-reporting questionnaire. They instilled their eye drop, and the technique was video-recorded digitally and later graded by two masked investigators. The results were analyzed using Fisher's exact test and Chi-square test. Predictors were assessed using logistic regression models. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in overall performance scores between the two groups. Good technique was observed in 16% of (A) group versus 23% (NA) group, (P = 0.498). There was a mismatch between patient's subjective and actual performance. Female gender and higher educational level were found to be predictors of good performance of drop instillation on univariable logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSION: Glaucoma patients are challenged with eye drop instillation despite receiving education on drop administration. There is a discrepancy between patient's perceptions and observed technique of drop administration.

27012911|t|Effectiveness comparison of cardio-selective to non-selective b-blockers and their association with mortality and morbidity in end-stage renal disease: a retrospective cohort study.
27012911|a|BACKGROUND: Within-class comparative effectiveness studies of b-blockers have not been performed in the chronic dialysis setting. With widespread cardiac disease in these patients and potential mechanistic differences within the class, we examined whether mortality and morbidity outcomes varied between cardio-selective and non-selective b-blockers. METHODS: Retrospective observational study of within class b-blocker exposure among a national cohort of new chronic dialysis patients (N   =   52,922) with hypertension and dual eligibility (Medicare-Medicaid). New b-blocker users were classified according to their exclusive use of one of the subclasses. Outcomes were all-cause mortality (ACM) and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (CVMM). The associations of cardio-selective and non-selective agents on outcomes were adjusted for baseline characteristics using Cox proportional hazards. RESULTS: There were 4938 new b-blocker users included in the ACM model and 4537 in the CVMM model: 77  % on cardio-selective b-blockers. Exposure to cardio-selective and non-selective agents during the follow-up period was comparable, as measured by proportion of days covered (0.56 vs. 0.53 in the ACM model; 0.56 vs 0.54 in the CVMM model). Use of cardio-selective b-blockers was associated with lower risk for mortality (AHR   =   0.84; 99  % CI   =   0.72-0.97, p   =   0.0026) and lower risk for CVMM events (AHR   =   0.86; 99  % CI   =   0.75-0.99, p   =   0.0042). CONCLUSION: Among new b-blockers users on chronic dialysis, cardio-selective agents were associated with a statistically significant 16  % reduction in mortality and 14  % in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality relative to non-selective b-blocker users. A randomized clinical trial would be appropriate to more definitively answer whether cardio-selective b-blockers are superior to non-selective b-blockers in the setting of chronic dialysis.

27012523|t|Opportunity costs and local health service spending decisions: a qualitative study from Wales.
27012523|a|BACKGROUND: All health care systems face the need to find the resources to meet new demands such as a new, cost-increasing health technology. In England and Wales, when a health technology is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the National Health Service (NHS) is mandated to provide the funding to accommodate it within three months of publication of the recommendation. Identifying what, in practice, is foregone when new cost-increasing technologies are introduced is important for understanding the effects of health technology assessment (HTA) decisions on the NHS or any other health care system. Our objective was to investigate how in practice local NHS commissioners in Wales accommodated financial "shocks" arising from technology appraisals (TAs) issued by NICE and from other cost pressures. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with Finance Directors and Medical Directors from all seven Local Health Boards (LHBs) in NHS Wales. These interviews covered prioritisation processes, as well as methods of financing NICE TAs and other financial shocks at each LHB. We then undertook a systematic identification of themes and topics from the information recorded. The study relates to the period October 2010 to March 2013. RESULTS: The financial impact of NICE TAs is generally anticipated and planned for in advance and the majority of LHBs have contingency funds available to cope with these and other financial shocks within-period. Efficiency savings (defined as reductions in costs with no assumed reductions in quality) were a source of funds for cost pressures of all kinds. Service displacements were not linkable to particular NICE TAs and there appears to be a general lack of explicit prioritisation activities. The Welsh Government has, on occasion, explicitly or implicitly acted as the funder of last resort. CONCLUSIONS: Services may be displaced as part of a response to the cumulative impact of all types of cost pressures, including cost-increasing health technologies recommended by NICE, but such displacements were not direct responses to the publication of individual NICE TAs. The additional cost pressure represented by a new NICE TA is likely to be accommodated at least partly by greater efficiency and increased expenditure rather than displacement of services.

27086072|t|Mercury bioaccumulation in an estuarine predator: Biotic factors, abiotic factors, and assessments of fish health.
27086072|a|UNASSIGNED: Estuarine wetlands are major contributors to mercury (Hg) transformation into its more toxic form, methylmercury (MeHg). Although these complex habitats are important, estuarine Hg bioaccumulation is not well understood. The longnose gar Lepisosteus osseus (L. 1758), an estuarine predator in the eastern United States, was selected to examine Hg processes due to its abundance, estuarine residence, and top predator status. This study examined variability in Hg concentrations within longnose gar muscle tissue spatially and temporally, the influence of biological factors, potential maternal transfer, and potential negative health effects on these fish. Smaller, immature fish had the highest Hg concentrations and were predominantly located in low salinity waters. Sex and diet were also important factors and Hg levels peaked in the spring. Although maternal transfer occurred in small amounts, the potential negative health effects to young gar remain unknown. Fish health as measured by fecundity and growth rate appeared to be relatively unaffected by Hg at concentrations in the present study (less than 1.3  ppm wet weight). The analysis of biotic and abiotic factors relative to tissue Hg concentrations in a single estuarine fish species provided valuable insight in Hg bioaccumulation, biomagnification, and elimination. Insights such as these can improve public health policy and environmental management decisions related to Hg pollution.

27086930|t|Damage-associated molecular patterns in cancer: a double-edged sword.
27086930|a|UNASSIGNED: Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are released in response to cell death and stress, and are potent triggers of sterile inflammation. Recent evidence suggests that DAMPs may also have a key role in the development of cancer, as well as in the host response to cytotoxic anti-tumor therapy. As such, DAMPs may exert protective functions by alerting the immune system to the presence of dying tumor cells, thereby triggering immunogenic tumor cell death. On the other hand, cell death and release of DAMPs may also trigger chronic inflammation and, thereby promote the development or progression of tumors. Here, we will review the contribution of candidate DAMPs and their receptors, and discuss the evidence for DAMPs as tumor-promoting and anti-tumor effectors, as well as unsolved questions such as DAMP release from non-tumor cells as well as the existence of tumor-specific DAMPs.Oncogene advance online publication, 18 April 2016; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.104.

27060636|t|Water treatment residual (WTR)-coated wood mulch for alleviation of toxic metals and phosphorus from polluted urban stormwater runoff.
27060636|a|UNASSIGNED: Aluminum-based water treatment residual (WTR)-coated wood mulches were synthesized and tested for removal of heavy metals and phosphorus (P) in synthetic urban stormwater. WTRs are an industrial waste produced from coagulation in water treatment facilities, primarily composed of amorphous aluminum or iron hydroxides. Batch tests showed that the composite filter media could effectively adsorb 97% lead (Pb), 76% zinc (Zn), 81% copper (Cu) and 97% P from the synthetic stormwater (Pb  =  100   g/L, Zn  =  800   g/L, Cu  =  100   g/L, P  =  2.30  mg/L, and pH  =  7.0) within 120  min, due to the presence of aluminum hydroxides as an active adsorbent. The adsorption was a 2(nd)-order reaction with respect toward each pollutant. Column tests demonstrated that the WTR-coated mulches considerably alleviated the select pollutants under a continuous-flow condition over the entire filtration period. The effluent Pb, Zn, Cu, and P varied at 0.5-8.9%, 33.4-46.7%, 45.8-55.8%, and 6.4-51.9% of their respective initial concentrations with the increasing bed volume from 0 to 50. Synthetic precipitation leaching procedure (SPLP) and toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) tests indicated that leached contaminants were all below the U.S. criteria, suggesting that the release of undesired chemicals under rainfall or landfilling conditions is not a concern during application. This study demonstrates that the WTR-coated mulches are a new, low-cost, and effective filter media for urban stormwater treatment. Equally important, this study provides a sustainable approach to beneficially reuse an industrial waste for environmental pollution control.

27035255|t|Eclipta yellow vein virus enhances chlorophyll destruction, singlet oxygen production and alters endogenous redox status in Andrographis paniculata.
27035255|a|UNASSIGNED: The infection of Eclipta yellow vein virus [EcYVV-IN, Accession No. KC476655], recently reported for the first time, on Andrographis paniculata was studied for redox-mediated alteration mechanism in infected plants. A.  paniculata, an important medicinal plant, is used in traditional Indian, Chinese and modern system of medicine. Andrographolide, one of the foremost components of this plant, is known for its varied pharmacological properties. Our investigation provides insight into the effect of virus-induced changes in the singlet oxygen quenching due to the alteration in pigment content (chlorophyll and carotenoids) as well as activation of plant secondary metabolism along with defense activation leading to changes in enzymatic and non-enzymatic redox status. Due to infection, a reduction in carotenoid content was observed which leads to reduced quenching of singlet oxygen. An increased level of enzymatic (SOD and APX) and non-enzymatic antioxidant (DPPH, FRAP, RP, NO, TAC and TP) activities were also observed in virus-infected plants with a positive correlation (>0.9). However, CAT activity was diminished which could be either due to its proteolytic degradation or inactivation by superoxide anions (O(2-.)), NO or peroxynitrite radicals. A significant (p  <  0.05) increase in total phenolic content was observed in the infected plants while no considerable difference was seen in the total flavonoid content. Our results highlighted the alteration in redox status caused by virus-induced biotic stress on the plants and could be useful for understanding the after effects of viral infection This study could also be helpful in developing biomimetic methods for improving the production of secondary metabolites of pharmaceutical importance.

27061538|t|Synergistic enhancement of the antitumor activity of 5-fluorouracil by bornyl acetate in SGC-7901 human gastric cancer cells and the determination of the underlying mechanism of action.
27061538|a|PURPOSE: To investigate the anticancer activity of bornyl acetate and its combination with low dose 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in human gastric cancer (SGC-7901) cells and to evaluate their effects on cell cycle, apoptosis, cancer cell morphology and DNA fragmentation. METHODS: The anticancer activity of bornyl acetate, 5-FU and their combination against human gastric cancer (SGC-7901) cells was evaluated by MTT assay. Flow cytometry using propidium iodide (PI) as a staining agent was used to study the effect of the extract on cell cycle phase distribution. Apoptosis induced by bornyl acetate and 5-FU was evaluated by Annexin V binding assay using flow cytometer. Alterations in cell morphology following apoptosis was studied by fluorescence microscopy as well as transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: Bornyl acetate induced dose-dependent growth inhibitory effects on human gastric cancer cells in vitro.The combination of bornyl acetate with 5-FU induced a much more growth inhibitory effect on these cells indicating a synergistic enhancement of anticancer activity of 5-FU. The combined effect of bornyl acetate and 5-FU also resulted in greater apoptosis induction as well as cell cycle arrest in comparison to the individual treatment by bornyl acetate or 5-FU. Fluorescence microscopy as well as transmission electron microscopy also revealed that the combination of bornyl acetate with 5-FU resulted in greater apoptosis induction as well as cell morphology alterations. The percentages of early as well as late apoptotic cells were much higher in the combination treatment in comparison to separate treatment by bornyl acetate or 5-FU. CONCLUSION: Bornyl acetate potentiates the anticancer activity of 5-FU in human gastric cancer (SGC-7901) cells by inducing apoptosis, DNA fragmentation as well as G2/M cell cycle arrest.

27068923|t|Food safety behaviors observed in celebrity chefs across a variety of programs.
27068923|a|BACKGROUND: Consumers obtain information about foodborne illness prevention from many sources, including television media. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a variety of cooking shows with celebrity chefs to understand their modeling of food safety behaviors. METHODS: Cooking shows (100 episodes) were watched from 24 celebrity chefs preparing meat dishes. A tabulation of food safety behaviors was made for each show using a checklist. RESULTS: Proper modeling of food safety behaviors was limited, with many incidences of errors. For example, although all chefs washed their hands at the beginning of cooking at least one dish, 88% did not wash (or were not shown washing) their hands after handling uncooked meat. This was compounded with many chefs who added food with their hands (79%) or ate while cooking (50%). Other poor behaviors included not using a thermometer (75%), using the same cutting board to prepare ready-to-eat items and uncooked meat (25%), and other hygiene issues such as touching hair (21%) or licking fingers (21%). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that there is a need for improvement in demonstrated and communicated food safety behaviors among professional chefs. It also suggests that public health professionals must work to mitigate the impact of poorly modeled behaviors.

27025031|t|[NEOADJUVANT TARGET THERAPY IN A RENAL-CELL CANCER].
27025031|a|There were observed 30 patients (32 tumors), to whom preoperatively for renal-cell cancer (ROC) a neoadjuvant target therapy (NATTH) was conducted.

The indications for the NATTH conduction were: in 7 (21.9%) patients--a locally--spread RCC with the objective to localize a tumor and to search a further possibility of radical surgical intervention performance, and in 25 (78.1%)--the tumor reduction and searching possibility of the organpreserving treatment conduction. The NATTH conduction in the patients, suffering RCC, have guaranteed a primary pathological focus reduction in 90% of observations, and a partial regression in accordance to the RECIST criteria--in 28.1%. A tumor reduction by (22.9    17.8)% at average have permitted to perform a renal resection in 75% of observations, concerning localized RCC, when indication of preservation of enough functioning renal parenchyma was secured.

27024980|t|Lipoid Pneumonia and Sarcoidosis.
27024980|a|INTRODUCTION: Lipoid pneumonia is a rare, underdiagnosed disorder, and its combined presentation with sarcoidosis is even more unusual. METHODS: This paper presents a case in which both lipoid pneumonia and sarcoidosis were present, and includes the relevant literature review on lipoid pneumonia. RESULTS: Lipoid pneumonia may be acute or chronic in its presentation, resulting from exogenous or endogenous factors, or classified as idiopathic, with its precise incidence unknown. Radiographic changes maybe variable, but typically include lower lobe consolidation. Pathologic changes consist of an inflammatory giant cell reaction around lipid-related empty vacuoles and giant cell granulomas. Treatment in the case of exogenous lipoid pneumonia consists of removal of the offending oil ingestion. However, in endogenous lipoid pneumonia, treatment is aimed at the underlying cause, as there is no standard treatment. Repeated bronchoalveolar lavage, corticosteroids, and surgical resection have been used as therapies. The course of the disease is usually not progressive.

27110383|t|Sedentary behaviour among elite professional footballers: health and performance implications.
27110383|a|BACKGROUND: Elite athletes should have little concern about meeting recommended guidelines on physical activity. However, sedentary behaviour is considered a health risk independent of physical activity, and is recognised in public health guidelines advising against prolonged sedentary time. There has been very little research on athletes' physical activity behaviour outside elite sport. METHODS: Given health and performance links, we investigated in-season post-training activity levels in 28 elite professional footballers during the English Premiership season. Players volunteered to wear a triaxial wrist accelerometer for 1   week, removing it only for training and matches. In total, 25 players met the inclusion criteria for analysis. Players recorded on average 632.6   min wear time p/day during the post-training period (SD  52.9) for a mean of 3.8   days (SD  1.5). RESULTS: On average, players recorded 76.2   min p/day (SD  28.8) of moderate or vigorous activity post-training. The majority (79%) of post-training time was spent in sedentary activities (500.6   min per day  59.0). CONCLUSIONS: Professional footballers are alarmingly sedentary in their leisure time, and comparatively more so than non-athletic groups of a similar age and older. This raises questions over optimum recovery and performance, as well as long-term health and cardiovascular risk. Worryingly, retirement from elite sport is likely to further imbalance activity and sedentary behaviour. Promoting regular periodic light to moderate leisure time activity could be beneficial. Further research and provision of education and support for players is required in this area.

27011923|t|Single vs dual (en bloc) kidney transplants from donors  <= 5 years of age: A single center experience.
27011923|a|AIM: To compare outcomes between single and dual en bloc (EB) kidney transplants (KT) from small pediatric donors. METHODS: Monocentric nonprospective review of KTs from pediatric donors  <= 5 years of age. Dual EB KT was defined as keeping both donor kidneys attached to the inferior vena cava and aorta, which were then used as venous and arterial conduits for the subsequent transplant into a single recipient. Donor age was less useful than either donor weight or kidney size in decision-making for kidney utilization as kidneys from donors < 8 kg or kidneys < 6 cm in length were not transplanted. Post-transplant management strategies were standardized in all patients. RESULTS: From 2002-2015, 59 KTs were performed including 34 dual EB and 25 single KTs. Mean age of donors (17 mo vs 38 mo, P < 0.001), mean weight (11.0 kg vs 17.4 kg, P = 0.046) and male donors (50% vs 84%, P = 0.01) were lower in the dual EB compared to the single KT group, respectively. Mean cold ischemia time (21 h), kidney donor profile index (KDPI; 73% vs 62%) and levels of serum creatinine (SCr, 0.37 mg/dL vs 0.49 mg/dL, all P = NS) were comparable in the dual EB and single KT groups, respectively. Actuarial graft and patient survival rates at 5-years follow-up were comparable. There was one case of thrombosis resulting in graft loss in each group. Delayed graft function incidence (12% dual EB vs 20% single KT, P = NS) was slightly lower in dual EB KT recipients. Initial duration of hospital stay (mean 5.4 d vs 5.6 d) and the one-year incidences of acute rejection (6% vs 16%), operative complications (3% vs 4%), and major infection were comparable in the dual EB and single KT groups, respectively (all P = NS). Mean 12 mo SCr and abbreviated MDRD levels were 1.17 mg/dL vs 1.35 mg/dL and 72.5 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) vs 60.5 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) (both P = NS) in the dual EB and single KT groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: By transplanting kidneys from young pediatric donors into adult recipients, one can effectively expand the limited donor pool and achieve excellent medium-term outcomes.

27039127|t|Digoxin Toxicity and Use of Digoxin Immune Fab: Insights From a National Hospital Database.
27039127|a|OBJECTIVES: This study was developed to determine contemporary management of digoxin toxicity and clinical outcomes. BACKGROUND: Although the use of digoxin in heart failure management has declined, toxicity remains a prevalent complication. METHODS: The Premier Perspective Comparative Hospital Database (Premier Inc., Charlotte, North Carolina) was used to retrospectively identify patients diagnosed with digoxin toxicity and/or who received digoxin immune fab (DIF) over a  5-year period (2007-2011). DIF was evaluated using treatment date, number of vials administered, and total cost. Clinical outcomes included length of stay (total hospitalization; days after DIF), cost of hospitalization, and in-hospital mortality. Exploratory multivariate analyses were conducted to determine predictors of DIF and effect on length of stay, adjusting for patient characteristics and selection bias. RESULTS: Digoxin toxicity diagnosis without DIF treatment accounted for 19,543 cases; 5,004 patients received DIF of  whom 3086 had a diagnosis of toxicity. Most patients were >65 years old (88%). The predictors of DIF use were urgent/emergent admission, hyperkalemia, arrhythmia associated with digoxin toxicity, acute renal failure, or suicidal intent (odds ratios 1.7, 2.4, 3.6, 2.1, 3.7, respectively; p  < 0.0001 for all). The majority (78%) of DIF was administered on days 1 and 2 of the hospitalization; 10% received treatment after day 7. Digoxin was used after DIF administration in 14%  of cases. Among patients who received DIF within 2 days of admission, there was no difference for in-hospital mortality or  length of stay compared with patients not receiving DIF. CONCLUSIONS: Digoxin toxicity diagnoses are clustered in the elderly. One-fifth of cases receive treatment with DIF, most within 2 days of admission. Opportunities exist for improved diagnosis and post-DIF management. Prospective data may be required to assess the impact of DIF on length of stay.

27167027|t|Prospective observational study of conjunctival scarring after phacoemulsification.
27167027|a|PURPOSE: To examine whether anterior segment-optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) can detect conjunctival scarring after transscleral phacoemulsification and whether temporal transscleral phacoemulsification causes scarring in the superior conjunctiva. METHODS: Transscleral phacoemulsification was performed in the superior conjunctiva (superior incision group) or the temporal conjunctiva (temporal incision group). Anterior segment-optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) images of the superior conjunctiva were obtained before and after surgery. We quantified the thickness of the conjunctiva and preservation rates of the borderlines among the  subconjunctival layers. The relationship between the AS-OCT images and histology was evaluated in rabbit eyes with phacoemulsification. RESULTS: Each group comprised 25 patients. At  <=1  month after surgery, the superior conjunctiva was significantly thicker in the superior incision group than the temporal incision group (1  day, 7  days, and 1  month after surgery; p  <  0.0001, p  <  0.0001, and p  <  0.001 respectively); however, there were no significant differences between the two groups at >= 2  months. The borderline of the conjunctival stroma/Tenon's capsule and the borderline of the Tenon's capsule/sclera were preserved significantly better in the temporal incision group after surgery (p  <  0.0001). The cell densities in the conjunctiva of the rabbit temporal incision group were unchanged after surgery, whereas the rabbit superior incision group had significantly more neutrophils (p  =  0.0001) and myofibroblasts (p  <  0.0001) in the superior conjunctiva than the temporal incision group. CONCLUSIONS: Anterior segment-optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) images can detect conjunctival scarring after transscleral phacoemulsification. The layer structures in the superior conjunctiva are unaffected by temporal transscleral incision.

27164831|t|Bioinformatics analysis and construction of phylogenetic tree of aquaporins from Echinococcus granulosus.
27164831|a|UNASSIGNED: Cyst echinococcosis caused by the matacestodal larvae of Echinococcus granulosus (Eg), is a chronic, worldwide, and severe zoonotic parasitosis. The treatment of cyst echinococcosis is still difficult since surgery cannot fit the needs of all patients, and drugs can lead to serious adverse events as well as resistance. The screen of target proteins interacted with new anti-hydatidosis drugs is urgently needed to meet the prevailing challenges. Here, we analyzed the sequences and structure properties, and constructed a phylogenetic tree by bioinformatics methods. The MIP family signature and Protein kinase C phosphorylation sites were predicted in all nine EgAQPs. a-helix and random coil were the main secondary structures of EgAQPs. The numbers of transmembrane regions were three to six, which indicated that EgAQPs contained multiple hydrophobic regions. A neighbor-joining tree indicated that EgAQPs were divided into two branches, seven EgAQPs formed a clade with AQP1 from human, a "strict" aquaporins, other two EgAQPs formed a clade with AQP9 from human, an aquaglyceroporins. Unfortunately, homology modeling of EgAQPs was aborted. These results provide a foundation for understanding and researches of the biological function of E. granulosus.

27167138|t|Does Activin Receptor Blockade by Bimagrumab (BYM338) Pose Detrimental Effects on Bone Healing in a Rat Fibula Osteotomy Model?
27167138|a|UNASSIGNED: Bimagrumab (BYM338) is a novel fully human monoclonal antibody that exerts strong promyogenic effects on skeletal muscle by blocking activin type II receptors (ActRII). We investigated whether such blockade of ActRII by bimagrumab manifests any detrimental effect on outcomes of bone healing in a rat fibula osteotomy model. Animals (n  =  150) were divided into 11 groups and received weekly treatment with either bimagrumab (10 or 100  mg/kg) or vehicle. Progression and outcomes of bone healing were assessed by lateral radiographs in vivo as well as by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), 4-point bending test, and microscopic examination of the excised fibula at Day 29 or later. The radiographic progression of bone healing showed no significant differences between treatment groups in any comparative setting. In 3-month-old animals, pQCT revealed slightly reduced immature callus size and bone mineral content in bimagrumab-treated animals compared with vehicle-treated animals at Day 29 (p  <  0.05). There were, however, no differences in mature callus size, bone mineral density, or biomechanical competency. The aforementioned effects on immature callus size were not present when the treatment was initiated 4  weeks post osteotomy or when treating 6-month-old animals. In summary, these findings suggest that there is no major impact of ActRII blockade on overall fracture healing, and delayed treatment initiation can bypass the small and transient effect of the therapy on immature callus formation observed in younger animals. Verification of these findings in humans is the subject of an ongoing clinical trial on elderly hip fracture patients.

27033358|t|Clinical experience with contact-force and flexible-tip ablation catheter designs.
27033358|a|PURPOSE: Lesion formation is a critical determinant of technical and clinical success of pulmonary vein isolation. Different catheter designs aim to enhance tissue contact during ablation to enable optimized lesion formation. We analyzed procedural characteristics and predictors of clinical success in patients ablated with three different contemporary ablation catheters. METHODS: Two hundred sixty-eight sequentially included patients receiving pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) with conventional (n   =   122), contact-force (n   =   96) and flexible-tip (n   =   60) catheters were followed for a median of 14.1  months with 7d-Holter-monitoring and TTE at 3, 6, 12, and 24  months. Baseline characteristics and follow-up times were homogeneous across all groups. RESULTS: Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression for arrhythmia recurrence demonstrated a favorable hazard ratio for contact-force and flexible-tip catheters vs. conventional open irrigation catheters. Procedure time and fluoroscopy time were shorter for contact-force and flexible-tip catheters versus conventional catheters, but equal between. Linear lesions were applied in 58  % of contact-force and 66  % of flexible-tip cases, and CFAEs were targeted in 26  % of either. CONCLUSIONS: Our non-randomized prospectively collected data do not show a difference in observed procedure characteristics and in clinical outcome for flexible-tip versus contact-force catheter designs, while both display improved performance against conventional open irrigated-tip catheters. Linear lesions and CFAEs ablation were not associated with improved arrhythmia-free survival.

27044645|t|Mutanalyst, an online tool for assessing the mutational spectrum of epPCR libraries with poor sampling.
27044645|a|BACKGROUND: Assessing library diversity is an important control step in a directed evolution experiment. To do this, a limited amount of colonies from a test library are sequenced and tested. In the case of an error-prone PCR library, the spectrum of the identified mutations - the proportions of mutations of a specific nucleobase to another- is calculated enabling the user to make more informed predictions on library diversity and coverage. However, the calculations of the mutational spectrum are severely affected by the limited sample sizes. RESULTS: Here an online program, called Mutanalyst, is presented, which not only automates the calculations, but also estimates errors involved. Specifically, the errors are calculated thanks to the complementarity of DNA, which means that a mutation has a complementary mutation on the other sequence. Additionally, in the case of determining the mean number of mutations per sequence it does so by fitting to a Poisson distribution, which is more robust than calculating the average in light of the small sampling size. CONCLUSION: As a result of the added measures to keep into account of small sample size the user can better assess whether the library is satisfactory or whether error-prone PCR conditions should be adjusted. The program is available at www.mutanalyst.com .

27092640|a|UNASSIGNED: Three sets of flavonoid derivatives (N=32, 40, and 74) and logarithms of their dissociation constants (log Kd) that describe flavonoid affinity toward P-glycoprotein were modelled using six connectivity indices. The best results were obtained with the zero-order valence molecular connectivity index (0  v) for all three sets. Standard errors of the calibration models were around 0.3, and of the constants from the test sets even a little lower, 0.22 and 0.24. Despite using only one descriptor, our model proved better in internal (cross-validation) and especially in external (test set) statistics than much more demanding methods used in previous 3D QSAR modelling.

27117887|t|Serial follow-up of presurgical treatment using pasireotide long-acting release with or without octreotide long-acting release for na  ve active acromegaly.
27117887|a|UNASSIGNED: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the serial changes of GH and IGF-1 in seven patients with na  ve, active acromegaly following presurgical treatment of the somatostatin analog pasireotide long-acting release (LAR) and octreotide LAR. The patients were treated with pasireotide LAR with or without octreotide LAR for two years and underwent transsphenoidal adenomectomy. After treatment with the somatostatin analogs, the surgical cure rate was similar to that in patients who underwent transsphenoidal surgery alone. Diabetes insipidus was not identified in any patients after the operation. Pasireotide LAR was effective on GH as well as IGF-1 suppression and tumor size decreasing when used as the primary therapy. Future large-population studies to investigate the surgical curative rate after presurgical treatment with somatostatin analogs in patients with acromegaly and macroadenomas close to the cavernous sinus are warranted. However, that hyperglycemia developed following pre-surgical treatment with pasireotide should take into consideration.

27099609|t|A Case of Intraocular Erosion and Intrusion by an Arruga Suture.
27099609|a|PURPOSE: To report a case of intraocular erosion and intrusion by an Arruga suture. CASE REPORT: This study involved a 62-year-old male who had undergone scleral buckling surgery 40 or more years ago at another hospital for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, as well as trabeculectomy 20 years ago for primary open-angle glaucoma, in his left eye at the same hospital. However, he recently became aware of blurred vision in that eye. Upon examination, iritis was observed in the anterior portion of his left eye, as well as a great number of pigment cell keratoprecipitates on the posterior surface of the cornea. In the ocular fundus, extensive atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium and partial hyperpigmentation was observed, accompanied by subretinal strands, yet the retina remained attached. Around the entire peripheral area of the retina we observed a ring-shaped protrusion, but we also saw a shiny, filamentous material in the vitreous cavity that penetrated the sclera and choroid, completely extending from the 4- to 8-o'clock position of the scleral buckle protrusion. To treat the iritis in the patient's left eye, we began to administrate low-concentration steroid eye drops, after which the inflammation disappeared. CONCLUSION: In this study, we experienced a case of intraocular erosion and intrusion by an Arruga suture, and opted to treat the patient with steroid eye drops and conservative follow-up observations unless retinal redetachment and/or vitreous hemorrhage occurs.

27059558|t|Kramers turnover: From energy diffusion to spatial diffusion using metadynamics.
27059558|a|We consider the rate of transition for a particle between two metastable states coupled to a thermal environment for various magnitudes of the coupling strength using the recently proposed infrequent metadynamics approach [P. Tiwary and M. Parrinello, Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 230602 (2013)]. We are interested in understanding how this approach for obtaining rate constants performs as the dynamics regime changes from energy diffusion to spatial diffusion. Reassuringly, we find that the approach works remarkably well for various coupling strengths in the strong coupling regime, and to some extent even in the weak coupling regime.

27056904|t|Diagnosis of hearing loss using automated audiometry in an asynchronous telehealth model: A pilot accuracy study.
27056904|a|INTRODUCTION: Standard criteria exist for diagnosing different types of hearing loss, yet audiologists interpret audiograms manually. This pilot study examined the feasibility of standardised interpretations of audiometry in a telehealth model of care. The aim of this study was to examine diagnostic accuracy of automated audiometry in adults with hearing loss in an asynchronous telehealth model using pre-defined diagnostic protocols. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited 42 study participants from a public audiology and otolaryngology clinic in Perth, Western Australia. Manual audiometry was performed by an audiologist either before or after automated audiometry. Diagnostic protocols were applied asynchronously for normal hearing, disabling hearing loss, conductive hearing loss and unilateral hearing loss. Sensitivity and specificity analyses were conducted using a two-by-two matrix and Cohen's kappa was used to measure agreement. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity for the diagnostic criteria was 0.88 (range: 0.86-1) and overall specificity was 0.93 (range: 0.86-0.97). Overall kappa (k) agreement was 'substantial' k   =   0.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70-0.89) and significant at p   <   0.001. DISCUSSION: Pre-defined diagnostic protocols applied asynchronously to automated audiometry provide accurate identification of disabling, conductive and unilateral hearing loss. This method has the potential to improve synchronous and asynchronous tele-audiology service delivery.

27059957|t|Cadmium and Secondary Structure-dependent Function of a Degron in Pca1p Cadmium Exporter.
27059957|a|UNASSIGNED: Protein turnover is a critical cellular process regulating biochemical pathways and destroying terminally misfolded or damaged proteins. Pca1p, a cadmium exporter in yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, is rapidly degraded by the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) system via a cis-acting degron, which exists at the 250-350 amino acid region of Pca1p and is transferable to other proteins to serve as a degradation signal. Cadmium stabilizes Pca1p in a manner dependent on the degron. This suggested that cadmium-mediated masking of the degron impedes its interaction with the molecular factors involved in the ERAD. The characteristics and mechanisms of action of the degron in Pca1p and most of those in other proteins however remain to be determined. The results presented herein indicates that specific cysteine residues in a degron of Pca1p sense cadmium. An unbiased approach selecting non-functional degrons indicated a critical role of hydrophobic amino acids in the degron for its function. A secondary structure modeling predicted the formation of an amphipathic helix. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the functional significance of the hydrophobic patch. Lastly, hydrophobic amino acids in the degron and cadmium binding region affected the interaction of Pca1p with Ssa1p molecular chaperone which is involved in ERAD. These results reveal the mechanism of action of the degron, which might be useful for the identification and characterization of other degrons.

27091307|t|Glucocerebrosidase in Parkinson's disease: Insights into pathogenesis and prospects for treatment.
27091307|a|UNASSIGNED: PD involves several converging pathogenetic pathways to neurodegeneration; highlighted in specific cases by genetic mutations causing familial PD. Numerically, the most important genetic mutations associated with PD are those of the glucocerebrosidase gene. Approximately 10% of PD patients carry glucocerebrosidase mutations. This observation has enhanced focus on the autophagy-lysosome system as important in pathogenesis. The relationship of the glucocerebrosidase pathway to the cause and progression of PD highlights the potential to use abnormalities identified as biomarkers and modify glucocerebrosidase activity or substrate accumulation as neuroprotection. Biomarkers relevant to the glucocerebrosidase pathway, for example, enzyme activity and substrate levels, may be identified in blood, urine, and CSF. These may be combined with clinical features to help identify mutation carriers that are at increased risk of PD. The molecular mechanisms by which glucocerebrosidase mutations may result in PD are not fully understood. There is evidence accumulating that there is a reciprocal interaction between glucocerebrosidase and alpha-synuclein levels. This interaction may potentially be used to increase glucocerebrosidase enzyme activities and therefore reduce alpha-synuclein levels to modify the course of PD. Substrate reduction therapy may be an alternative strategy, particularly if membrane abnormalities underlie the organellar dysfunction in PD neurodegeneration.    2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

27051367|t|Evaluation of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II and sequential organ failure assessment scoring systems for prognostication of outcomes among Intensive Care Unit's patients.
27051367|a|CONTEXT: Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) are of the most validated and prevalent general scoring systems over the world. AIMS: The aim of the current study was to evaluate APACHE II and SOFA ability in predicting the outcomes (survivors, nonsurvivors) in surgical and medical Intensive Care Unit (ICU). SETTING AND DESIGN: This was an observational and prospective study of 300 consecutive patients admitted in surgical and medical ICU during a 6-month period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: APACHE II and SOFA scores and demographic characteristics were recorded for each patient separately in the first admission 24 h. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves, Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and logistic regression were used in the statistical analysis (95% confidence interval). RESULTS: Data analysis showed a significant statistical difference in APACHE II and SOFA scores between survivor and nonsurvivor patients (P < 0.0001, P = 0.001; respectively). The discrimination power was acceptable for APACHE II and poor for SOFA (area under ROC [AUC] curve: 73.7% (standard error [SE]: 3.2%), 63.4% [SE: 3.6%]; respectively). The acceptable calibration was seen just for SOFA (  (2) = 11.018, P = 0.051). CONCLUSIONS: Both APACHE II and SOFA showed good predictive accuracy for results in surgical and medical ICUs; however, the SOFA is the choice to select, because of being simpler and easier to record data.

27038061|t|Quality of Life Following Symptomatic Macromastia Surgery: Short- and Long-term Evaluation.
27038061|a|UNASSIGNED: Mammary hypertrophy or macromastia can cause a wide range of symptoms (physical, psychosomatic or behavioral), which affect patients' quality of life. Breast reduction can, in most of the cases, solve the problem. However, certain factors could have a negative effect on the outcome of surgery. The aims of this study were to discover the degree of patient satisfaction (short- and long-term) and to evaluate results of reduction mammoplasty, and also to ascertain which factors may have a negative role on the effectiveness of breast reduction surgery. We carried out a prospective and longitudinal study of 121 patients who underwent breast reduction surgery. Quality of life, outcome of surgery (complications and sequelae) and degree of patient satisfaction were evaluated at 1  month and at 1  year after reduction mammoplasty. Mean patient age was 40.71 (SD  =  12.02). Among them, 35.5% were overweight, 44.6% were obese and 34.7% were smokers. The most common symptom was pain. The mean amount of resected breast tissue was 1785  g (SD  =  876). A total of 27.3% of the patients suffered complications and 30.60% suffered sequelae. Our results show an improvement in symptoms (p  <  0.001) and quality of life (p  <  0.001 to p  =  0.002) 1  month after and 1  year after breast reduction compared with the preoperative situation. Neither age, body mass index, smoking habit nor the amount of tissue removed had a negative effect on the results of surgery. One year after surgery, the majority of patients were satisfied with the outcome (96.6%), they would recommend it to others (96.6%), and they would undergo surgery a second time (95.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Breast reduction is highly efficient in resolving symptoms and in improving quality of life. It leads to a high level of short- and long-term satisfaction irrespective of each patient's individual characteristics.

27023721|t|The Roles of Histidines and Charged Residues as Potential Triggers of a Conformational Change in the Fusion Loop of Ebola Virus Glycoprotein.
27023721|a|Ebola virus (EBOV) enters cells from late endosomes/lysosomes under mildly acidic conditions. Entry by fusion with the endosomal membrane requires the fusion loop (FL, residues 507-560) of the EBOV surface glycoprotein to undergo a pH-dependent conformational change. To find the pH trigger for this reaction we mutated multiple conserved histidines and charged and uncharged hydrophilic residues in the FL and measured their activity by liposome fusion and cell entry of virus-like particles. The FL location in the membrane was assessed by NMR using soluble and lipid-bound paramagnetic relaxation agents. While we could not identify a single residue to be alone responsible for pH triggering, we propose that a distributed pH effect over multiple residues induces the conformational change that enhances membrane insertion and triggers the fusion activity of the EBOV FL.

27043717|t|Interpretation of Spectroscopic Markers of H-Bonds.
27043717|a|UNASSIGNED: Quantum calculations are used to examine whether a AH      D H-bond is unambiguously verified by a downfield shift of the bridging proton's NMR signal or a red (or blue) shift of the AH stretching frequency in the IR spectrum.It is found that such IR band shifts will occur even if the two groups experience weak or no attractive force, or if they are drawn in so close together that their interaction is heavily repulsive.The mere presence of a proton-acceptor molecule can affect the chemical shielding of a position occupied by a proton-donor by virtue of its electron density, even if there is no H-bond present.This density-induced shielding is heavily dependent on position around the proton-acceptor atom, and varies from one group to another.Evidence of a H-bond rests on the measurement of a proton deshielding in excess of what is caused purely by the presence of the proton acceptor species.

27017166|t|Perioperative blood transfusion is not associated with overall survival or time to recurrence after resection of perihilar cholangiocarcinoma.
27017166|a|BACKGROUND: Perioperative blood transfusions have been associated with worse oncological outcome in several types of cancer. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of perioperative blood transfusions on time to recurrence and overall survival (OS) in patients who underwent curative-intent resection of perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (PHC). METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included consecutive patients with resected PHC between 1992 and 2013 in a specialized center. Patients with 90-day mortality after surgery were excluded. Patients who did and did not receive perioperative blood transfusions were compared using univariable Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariable Cox regression. RESULTS: Of 145 included patients, 80 (55.2%) received perioperative blood transfusions. The median OS was 49 months for patients without and 41 months for patients with blood transfusions (P  =  0.46). In risk-adjusted multivariable Cox regression analysis, blood transfusion was not associated with OS (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.59-1.68, P  =  0.99) or time to recurrence (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.57-1.78, P  =  0.99). In addition, no differences in effect were found between different types of blood products transfused. CONCLUSION: Blood transfusion was not associated with survival or time to recurrence after curative resection of PHC in this series. The alleged association is presumably related to the circumstances necessitating blood transfusions.

27051203|t|Utilization of carrageenan, citric acid and cinnamon oil as an edible coating of chicken fillets to prolong its shelf life under refrigeration conditions.
27051203|a|AIM: The present study was conducted to determine efficacy of edible coating of carrageenan and cinnamon oil to enhance the shelf life of chicken meat stored under refrigeration conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chicken breast was coated with carrageenan and cinnamon oil by three methods of application viz., spraying brushing and dipping. The coated meat was evaluated for drip loss, pH, thiobarbituric acid number (TBA), tyrosine value (TV), extract release volume (ERV), Warner-Bratzler shear force value (WBSFV), instrumental color, microbiological, and sensory qualities as per standard procedures. RESULTS: There was a significant difference observed for physicochemical parameters (pH, TBA, TV, ERV, drip loss and WBSFV) and microbiological analysis between storage periods in all the samples and between the control and treatments throughout the storage period but samples did not differed significantly for hunter color scores. However, there was no significant difference among three methods of application throughout the storage period though dipping had a lower rate of increase. A progressive decline in mean sensory scores was recorded along with the increase in storage time. CONCLUSION: The carrageenan and cinnamon edible coating was found to be a good alternative to enhance the shelf life of chicken meat under refrigeration conditions. It was also observed from study that dipping method of the application had comparatively higher shelf life than other methods of application.

27044027|a|UNASSIGNED: Asthma is an inflammatory disease that is characterized by a predominance of eosinophils and/or neutrophils in the airways. In the resolution of inflammation, lipid mediators such as resolvin D1 (RvD1) and its epimer aspirin-triggered RvD1 (AT-RvD1) are produced and demonstrate anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution effects. In experimental models such as airway allergic inflammation induced by ovalbumin in mice, RvD1 and AT-RvD1 alleviate some of the most important phenotypes of asthma. Here, we demonstrated the effects of AT-RvD1 on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy individuals and patients with severe asthma stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (DM). AT-RvD1 (100nM) reduced the concentration of TNF-a in PBMCs from healthy individuals and patients with severe asthma stimulated with LPS or DM. In addition, AT-RvD1 lowered the production of IL-10 only in PBMCs from patients with severe asthma stimulated with LPS. These effects were associated in part with decreasing NF-kB activation. Moreover, AT-RvD1 significantly increased phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils by monocytes from patients with severe asthma. In conclusion, AT-RvD1 demonstrated both anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution effects in PBMCs from patients with severe asthma and could become in the future an alternative treatment for asthma.

27130232|t|The Effect of Levonorgestrel on Fibrinolytic Factors in Human Endometrial Endothelial Cells.
27130232|a|OBJECTIVE: The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system is considered a highly effective treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB). While LNG has established effects on the stromal and glandular compartments of the endometrial tissue, its effect on the endometrial endothelial cells has not been investigated. We examined whether LNG regulates fibrinolytic factors, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) secreted by human endometrial endothelial cells (HEECs) and determined the steroid receptor through which LNG exerts its effect on the endothelium. METHODS: The HEECs were treated with LNG or progesterone and levels of tPA and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) measured. The HEECs were specifically examined for the presence of androgen receptors through Western blot. Levonorgestrel    flutamide were added to HEECs and the levels of tPA and uPA were examined. RESULTS: An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay performed on culture media confirmed a statistically significant decrease in tPA levels in cells treated with LNG (77.80%    8.0% of control; n = 5, P < .05 vs control) but not progesterone. The androgen receptor (110 kDa) was detected in HEEC lysates. The decrease in tPA was blocked by the addition of flutamide (101.3%    16% of control), a classic nonsteroidal androgen receptor blocker. There was no change in uPA or PAI-1 levels in cells treated with LNG. CONCLUSIONS: Levonorgestrel decreases tPA levels through the androgen receptor in HEECs. Thus, LNG inhibits tPA secretion by the endometrial endothelial cell. This response suggests reduction in HMB with LNG-IUS could reflect an LNG-mediated promotion of hemostasis.

27129420|t|In vitro skin decontamination of the organophosphorus pesticide Paraoxon with nanometric cerium oxide CeO2.
27129420|a|UNASSIGNED: Organophosphorus compounds (OP), which mainly penetrate via the percutaneous pathway, represent a threat for both military and civilians. Body surface decontamination is vital to prevent victims poisoning. The development of a cost-effective formulation, which could be efficient and easy to handle in case of mass contamination, is therefore crucial. Metal oxides nanoparticles, due their large surface areas and the large amount of highly reactive sites, present high reactivity towards OP. First, this study aimed at evaluating the reaction of CeO2 nanoparticles, synthetized by microwave path and calcined at 500 or 600    C, with Paraoxon (POX) in aqueous solution. Results showed that both nanoparticles degraded 60% to 70% of POX. CeO2 calcined at 500    C, owing to its larger specific area, was the most effective. Moreover, the degradation was significantly increased under Ultra-Violet irradiation (initial degradation rate doubled). Then, skin decontamination was studied in vitro using the Franz cell method with pig-ear skin samples. CeO2 powder and an aqueous suspension of CeO2 (CeO2-W) were applied 1  h after POX exposure. The efficiency of decontamination, including removal and/or degradation of POX, was compared to Fuller's earth (FE) and RSDL lotion which are, currently, the most efficient systems for skin decontamination. CeO2-W and RSDL were the most efficient to remove POX from the skin surface and decrease skin absorption by 6.4 compared to the control not decontaminated. FE reduced significantly (twice) the absorbed fraction of POX, contrarily to CeO2 powder. Considering only the degradation rate of POX, the products ranged in the order CeO2  >  RSDL  >  CeO2-W  >  FE (no degradation). This study showed that CeO2 nanoparticles are a promising material for skin decontamination of OP if formulated as a dispersion able to remove POX like CeO2-W and to degrade it as CeO2 powder.

27129917|t|Risk Factors Associated With Cognitive, Functional, and Behavioral Trajectories of Newly Diagnosed Dementia Patients.
27129917|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia results in changes in cognition, function, and behavior. We examine the effect of sociodemographic and clinical risk factors on cognitive, functional, and behavioral declines in incident dementia patients. METHODS: We used longitudinal data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center to evaluate cognitive (Mini-Mental State Exam [MMSE]), functional (Functional Activities Questionnaire [FAQ]), and behavioral (Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire [NPI-Q] severity score) trajectories for incident dementia patients over an 8-year period. We evaluated trajectories of 457 patients with mixed effects linear regression models. RESULTS: In the first year, cognition worsened by -1.518 (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.745, -1.291) MMSE points (0-30 scale). Education, race, and region of residence predicted cognition at diagnosis. Age of onset, geographic region of residence, and history of hypertension and congestive heart failure predicted cognitive changes. Function worsened by 3.464 (95% CI 3.131, 3.798) FAQ points in the first year (0-30 scale). Cognition, gender, race, region of residence and place of residence, and a history of stroke and hypercholesterolemia predicted function at diagnosis. Place of residence and a history of diabetes predicted functional changes. Behavioral symptoms worsened by 0.354 (95% CI 0.123, 0.585) NPI-Q points in the first year (0-36 scale). Age of onset, region of residence, and history of hypertension and psychiatric problems predicted behaviors at diagnosis. Cognition explained changes in behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Sociodemographic characteristics and clinical comorbidities predict cognitive and functional changes. Only cognitive status explains behavioral decline. Results provide an understanding of the characteristics that impact cognitive, functional, and behavioral decline.

27100851|t|Energetics of ligand-receptor binding affinity on endothelial cells: An in vitro model.
27100851|a|UNASSIGNED: Targeted therapies represent a challenge in modern medicine. In this contest, we propose a rapid and reliable methodology based on Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) coupled with confluent cell layers cultured around biocompatible templating microparticles to quantify the number of overexpressing receptors on cell membrane and study the energetics of receptor-ligand binding in near-physiological conditions. In the in vitro model here proposed we used the bEnd3 cell line as brain endothelial cells to mimic the blood brain barrier (BBB) cultured on dextran microbeads ranging from 67 m to 80 m in size (Cytodex) and the primary human umbilical vein cells (HUVEC) for comparison. The revealed affinity between transferrin (Tf) and transferrin receptor (TfR) in both systems is very high, Kd values are in the order of nM. Conversely, the value of TfRs/cell reveals a 100-fold increase in the number of TfRs per bEnd3 cells compared to HUVEC cells. The presented methodology can represent a novel and helpful strategy to identify targets, to address drug design and selectively deliver therapeutics that can cross biological barriers such as the blood brain barrier.

27025636|t|Antibiotic Stewardship Initiatives as Part of the UK 5-Year Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy.
27025636|a|Antibiotic use is a major driver for the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. Antimicrobial stewardship programmes aim to improve antibiotic prescribing with the objectives of optimizing clinical outcomes while at the same time minimizing unintended consequences such as adverse effects and the selection of antibiotic resistance. In 2013, a five-year national strategy for tackling antimicrobial resistance was published in the UK. The overarching goal of the strategy is to slow the development and spread of resistance and to this end it has three strategic aims, namely to improve knowledge and understanding of resistance, to conserve and steward the effectiveness of existing treatments and to stimulate the development of new antibiotics, diagnostics and novel therapies. This article reviews the antimicrobial stewardship activities included in the strategy and describes their implementation and evaluation.

27036939|t|I-bodies: human single domain antibodies that antagonize chemokine receptor CXCR4.
27036939|a|UNASSIGNED: CXCR4 is a G protein-coupled receptor with excellent potential as a therapeutic target for a range of clinical conditions including stem cell mobilization, cancer prognosis and treatment, fibrosis therapy and HIV. We report here the development of a fully human single-domain antibody-like scaffold termed an i-body, the engineering of which produces an i-body library possessing a long complementarity determining region (CDR) binding loop, and the isolation and characterisation of a panel of i-bodies with activity against human CXCR4. The CXCR4-specific i-bodies show antagonistic activity in a range of in vitro and in vivo assays including inhibition of HIV infection, cell migration and leukocyte recruitment but, importantly, not mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells. Epitope mapping of three CXCR4 i-bodies AM3-114, AM4-272 and AM3-523 revealed binding deep in the binding pocket of the receptor.

27004526|t|Biocidal effects of stem bark extract of Chrysophyllum albidium G. Don on vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
27004526|a|BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus causes variety of infections in humans and animals worldwide and predominates in surgical wound infections. This study assessed the antimicrobial potential of the stem bark extract of Chrysophyllum albidum against an array of vancomycin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) isolated from clinical samples. METHODS: The methanolic crude extract of the plant was preliminary screened for the presence of phytochemicals; after then, the extract was partitioned into n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and butanol fractions. A range of concentrations of the plant extract fractions was prepared to assess its antimicrobial potency; the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs); the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs); the rate of killing; the potassium ion leakage potential and nucleotides leakage ability against the VRSAs. RESULTS: The phytochemical screening revealed the presence of tannins, alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, reducing sugars and terpenoids as major phytoconstituents resident in the crude plant extract. The two active fractions (n-hexane and butanol) at a concentration of 10  mg/ml exhibited antibacterial activities with the MIC and MBC values for the fractions ranged between 0.63-10  mg/ml and 1.25-10  mg/ml respectively. The time kill assay revealed that the antibacterial action of the two fractions are time and concentration dependent; the n-hexane and butanol fractions achieved 100  % kill on the test isolates at a concentration of 3   *   MIC and 2   *   MIC respectively after 120  min of reaction time. Varying amount of potassium ions as well as nucleotides were leaked from the test cells by n-hexane and butanol fractions. CONCLUSIONS: This study has established the possibility of developing antimicrobial agents of natural origin to manage possible infection from vancomycin resistant Staphylococcus aureus that are now developing multi-resistance against many antibiotics.

27007952|t|Incipient Social Groups: An Analysis via In-Vivo Behavioral Tracking.
27007952|a|UNASSIGNED: Social psychology is fundamentally the study of individuals in groups, yet there remain basic unanswered questions about group formation, structure, and change. We argue that the problem is methodological. Until recently, there was no way to track who was interacting with whom with anything approximating valid resolution and scale. In the current study we describe a new method that applies recent advances in image-based tracking to study incipient group formation and evolution with experimental precision and control. In this method, which we term "in vivo behavioral tracking," we track individuals' movements with a high definition video camera mounted atop a large field laboratory. We report results of an initial study that quantifies the composition, structure, and size of the incipient groups. We also apply in-vivo spatial tracking to study participants' tendency to cooperate as a function of their embeddedness in those crowds. We find that participants form groups of seven on average, are more likely to approach others of similar attractiveness and (to a lesser extent) gender, and that participants' gender and attractiveness are both associated with their proximity to the spatial center of groups (such that women and attractive individuals are more likely than men and unattractive individuals to end up in the center of their groups). Furthermore, participants' proximity to others early in the study predicted the effort they exerted in a subsequent cooperative task, suggesting that submergence in a crowd may predict social loafing. We conclude that in vivo behavioral tracking is a uniquely powerful new tool for answering longstanding, fundamental questions about group dynamics.

27004887|t|Effect of the electrostatic surface potential on the oligomerization of full-length human recombinant prion protein at single-molecule level.
27004887|a|The electrostatic surface potential (ESP) of prion oligomers has critical influences on the aggregating processes of the prion molecules. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) and structural simulation were combined to investigate the molecular basis of the full-length human recombinant prion oligomerization on mica surfaces. The high resolution non-intrusive AFM images showed that the prion oligomers formed different patterns on mica surfaces at different buffer pH values. The basic binding units for the large oligomers were determined to be prion momoners (Ms), dimers (Ds), and trimers (Ts). The forming of the D and T units happened through the binding of hydrophobic b-sheets of the M units. In contrast, the a-helices of these M, D, and T units were the binding areas for the formation of large oligomers. At pH 4.5, the binding units M, D, and T showed clear polarized ESP distributions on the surface domains, while at pH 7.0, they showed more evenly distributed ESPs. Based on the conformations of oligomers observed from AFM images, the D and T units were more abundantly on mica surface at pH 4.5 because the ESP re-distribution of M units helped to stabilize these larger oligomers. The amino acid side chains involved in the binding interfaces were stabilized by hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. The detailed analysis of the charged side chains at pH 4.5 indicated that the polarized ESPs induced the aggregations among M, D, and T to form larger oligomers. Therefore, the hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions worked together to form the stabilized prion oligomers.

27000525|t|Attenuation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation by Vitexin: A combinatorial study with azithromycin and gentamicin.
27000525|a|Microbial biofilm are communities of surface-adhered cells enclosed in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances. Extensive use of antibiotics to treat biofilm associated infections has led to the emergence of multiple drug resistant strains. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is recognised as a model biofilm forming pathogenic bacterium. Vitexin, a polyphenolic group of phytochemical with antimicrobial property, has been studied for its antibiofilm potential against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in combination with azithromycin and gentamicin. Vitexin shows minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) at 260    g/ml. It's antibiofilm activity was evaluated by safranin staining, protein extraction, microscopy methods, quantification of EPS and in vivo models using several sub-MIC doses. Various quorum sensing (QS) mediated phenomenon such as swarming motility, azocasein degrading protease activity, pyoverdin and pyocyanin production, LasA and LasB activity of the bacteria were also evaluated. Results showed marked attenuation in biofilm formation and QS mediated phenotype of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in presence of 110    g/ml vitexin in combination with azithromycin and gentamicin separately. Molecular docking of vitexin with QS associated LuxR, LasA, LasI and motility related proteins showed high and reasonable binding affinity respectively. The study explores the antibiofilm potential of vitexin against P. aeruginosa which can be used as a new antibiofilm agent against microbial biofilm associated pathogenesis.

27003658|t|[Robotic versus laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer: a meta-analysis].
27003658|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical efficacy with meta-analysis between robot-assisted gastrectomy(RAG) and laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy (LAG) for gastric cancer. METHODS: A literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Wanfang Data, CNKI(Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure), and CBM(China Biological Medicine) databases for clinical researches published before July 2015 that compared RAG with LAG. Operative time, estimated blood loss, harvested lymph nodes, proximal margin, distal margin, hospital stay, conversion and complications were compared using weighted mean differences(WMD) and odds ratios (OR). RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included in the analysis, comprising 5 764 patients(1 593 RAGs, 4 171 LAGs). RAG was associated with longer operative time (WMD=49.68, 95% CI: 35.54 to 63.82, P=0.000), less estimated blood loss (WMD=-26.10, 95% CI: -42.90 to -9.31, P=0.002), and shorter hospital stay(WMD=-0.72, 95% CI: -1.35 to -0.09, P=0.024). Conversion, mortality, complications, proximal margin, distal margin and harvested lymph nodes of RAG were similar to LAG. In meta-analysis results of distal gastrectomy and early-stage gastric cancer, RAG had more harvested lymph nodes (distal gastrectomy: WMD=2.23, 95% CI: 0.33 to 4.13, P=0.021; early-stage gastric cancer: WMD=2.58, 95% CI: 1.05 to 4.12, P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: RAG can be performed safely with less estimated blood loss and more harvested lymph nodes as compared to LAG. Radical resection can be achieved by RAG.

27106737|t|Downregulation of ATM Gene and Protein Expression in Canine Mammary Tumors.
27106737|a|UNASSIGNED: The ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene encodes a protein associated with DNA damage repair and maintenance of genomic integrity. In women, ATM transcript and protein downregulation have been reported in sporadic breast carcinomas, and the absence of ATM protein expression has been associated with poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate ATM gene and protein expression in canine mammary tumors and their association with clinical outcome. ATM gene and protein expression was evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively, in normal mammary gland samples (n = 10), benign mammary tumors (n = 11), nonmetastatic mammary carcinomas (n = 19), and metastatic mammary carcinomas (n = 11). Lower ATM transcript levels were detected in benign mammary tumors and carcinomas compared with normal mammary glands (P = .011). Similarly, lower ATM protein expression was observed in benign tumors (P = .0003), nonmetastatic mammary carcinomas (P < .0001), and the primary sites of metastatic carcinomas (P < .0001) compared with normal mammary glands. No significant differences in ATM gene or protein levels were detected among benign tumors and nonmetastatic and metastatic mammary carcinomas (P > .05). The levels of ATM gene or protein expression were not significantly associated with clinical and pathological features or with survival. Similar to human breast cancer, the data in this study suggest that ATM gene and protein downregulation is involved in canine mammary gland tumorigenesis.

27106541|t|The Distribution of Elements in 48 Canine Compact Bone Types Using Handheld X-Ray Fluorescence.
27106541|a|UNASSIGNED: A major question when we talk about the elements in the bone is whether all bones contain the same elements. To answer this question, this study was designed for determination of the elemental levels in 48 various canine compact bones using handheld X-ray fluorescence technique. From a total of 26 elements that could be detected, only 13 elements were found in all 48 bones. The sternum and os penis were significantly different from the other bones in that they contained the highest number of elements. The ratio of Ca and P was significantly different when comparing certain bones: there was a higher Ca/P ratio in the patella (right), calcaneus (right and left), and sternum compared with a lower ratio in the radius (left), rib (left), phalanx (left forelimb), and carpus (left). These results are the first to demonstrate that different types of bones have different elemental profiles, even for major elements such as Ca and P. Moreover, the Ca/P ratio was also different between bone types. This data is important for the selection of bones appropriate to the element studied. In addition, the results proved that the elements were not equally distributed in every bone in the body.

27106273|t|Admixture mapping identifies introgressed genomic regions in North American canids.
27106273|a|UNASSIGNED: Hybrid zones typically contain novel gene combinations that can be tested by natural selection in a unique genetic context. Parental haplotypes that increase fitness are likely to introgress beyond the hybrid zone, into the range of the other parental species. We used the Affymetrix canine SNP genotyping array to identify genomic regions tagged by multiple ancestry informative markers that are more frequent in an admixed population than expected. We surveyed a hybrid zone formed in the last 100 years as coyotes expanded their range into eastern North America. Concomitant with expansion, coyotes hybridized with wolves and some populations became more wolf-like, such that coyotes in the northeast have the largest body size of any coyote population. Using a set of 3,102 ancestry informative markers, we identified 60 differentially introgressed regions in 44 canines across this admixture zone. These regions are characterized by an excess of exogenous ancestry and, in northeastern coyotes, are enriched for genes affecting body size and skeletal proportions. Further, introgressed wolf-derived alleles have penetrated into Southern US coyote populations. Because no wolves currently exist in this area, these alleles are unlikely to have originated from recent hybridization. Instead they likely originated from intraspecific gene flow or ancient admixture. We show that grey wolf and coyote admixture has far-reaching effects and, in addition to phenotypically transforming admixed populations, allows for the differential movement of alleles from different parental species to be tested in new genomic backgrounds.

27106050|t|The effects of feeding and withholding food on the canine small intestinal microbiota.
27106050|a|UNASSIGNED: Prolonged lack of enteral feeding has a negative impact on gut physiology, potentially via microbiota modulation. The aims were to investigate the impact of fasting and postprandial changes in canine jejunal microbiota. To study postprandial effects, jejunal brushings were analyzed in 8 healthy fistulated dogs 15 minutes before feeding (baseline) and hourly for 8 hours after feeding. To study effects of withholding food (WF), daily samples were collected for 15 days from 5 dogs. The first 5 days (PRE) dogs were fed regular diet. Food was withheld the next 5 days (days 6-10). For days 11-15 (POST), the original diet was reintroduced. Microbiota was characterized via denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 454-pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes. In the postprandial study, no changes in microbiome structure were seen after feeding (ANOSIM, p = 0.28), but Betaproteobacteria (p = 0.04) and Bacteroidales decreased compared to baseline. Species richness decreased by 300 minutes (p = 0.04). During WF, microbiota structure differed from PRE and POST period (p = 0.001). During WF, species richness did not vary over time (p = 0.69). In conclusion, a prolonged period of food withholding results in altered jejunal microbiota. How these changes affect the microbiota metabolism warrants further studies.

27030598|t|Diversification of the antigen-specific T cell receptor repertoire after varicella zoster vaccination.
27030598|a|Diversity and size of the antigen-specific T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire are two critical determinants for successful control of chronic infection. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) that establishes latency during childhood can escape control mechanisms, in particular with increasing age. We examined the TCR diversity of VZV-reactive CD4 T cells in individuals older than 50 years by studying three identical twin pairs and three unrelated individuals before and after vaccination with live attenuated VZV. Although all individuals had a small number of dominant T cell clones, the breadth of the VZV-specific repertoire differed markedly. A genetic influence was seen for the sharing of individual TCR sequences from antigen-reactive cells but not for repertoire richness or the selection of dominant clones. VZV vaccination favored the expansion of infrequent VZV antigen-reactive TCRs, including those from na  ve T cells with lesser boosting of dominant T cell clones. Thus, vaccination does not reinforce the in vivo selection that occurred during chronic infection but leads to a diversification of the VZV-reactive T cell repertoire. However, a single-booster immunization seems insufficient to establish new clonal dominance. Our results suggest that repertoire analysis of antigen-specific TCRs can be an important readout to assess whether a vaccination was able to generate memory cells in clonal sizes that are necessary for immune protection.

27040985|t|A role for TENM1 mutations in Congenital General Anosmia.
27040985|a|UNASSIGNED: Congenital general anosmia (CGA) is a neurological disorder entailing a complete innate inability to sense odors. While the mechanisms underlying vertebrate olfaction have been studied in detail, there are still gaps in our understanding of the molecular genetic basis of innate olfactory disorders. Applying whole-exome sequencing to a family multiply affected with CGA, we identified three members with a rare X-linked missense mutation in the TENM1 (teneurin 1) gene (ENST00000422452:c.C4829T). In Drosophila melanogaster, TENM1 functions in synaptic-partner-matching between axons of olfactory sensory neurons and target projection neurons and is involved in synapse organization in the olfactory system. We used CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate a Tenm1 disrupted mouse model. Tenm1(-/-) and point-mutated Tenm1(A) (/A) adult mice were shown to have an altered ability to locate a buried food pellet. Tenm1(A) (/A) mice also displayed an altered ability to sense aversive odors. Results of our study, that describes a new Tenm1 mouse, agree with the hypothesis that TENM1 has a role in olfaction. However, additional studies should be done in larger CGA cohorts, to provide statistical evidence that loss-of-function mutations in TENM1 can solely cause the disease in our and other CGA cases.

In such systems, each component may respond to changes in any directly or indirectly connected components, thus requiring knowledge of the whole to predict the dynamics of the parts. Here, we address this challenge by deriving relations between properties of fluctuations that only reflect local interactions between a subset of components but are invariant to all indirectly connected dynamics. This greatly reduces the number of assumptions when evaluating dynamic models experimentally. We illustrate the approach by revisiting systematic single-cell gene expression data, and we show that the observed fluctuations contradict the assumptions made in most published models of stochastic gene expression, even when accounting for the possibility of systematic experimental artifacts.

27105018|t|The role of isoforms in the evolution of cryptic coloration in Peromyscus mice.
27105018|a|UNASSIGNED: A central goal of evolutionary biology is to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic adaptation. While the contribution of protein-coding and cis-regulatory mutations to adaptive traits have been well documented, additional sources of variation-such as the production of alternative RNA transcripts from a single gene, or isoforms-have been understudied. Here, we focus on the pigmentation gene Agouti, known to express multiple alternative transcripts, to investigate the role of isoform usage in the evolution of cryptic color phenotypes in deer mice (genus Peromyscus). We first characterize the Agouti isoforms expressed in the Peromyscus skin and find two novel isoforms not previously identified in Mus. Next, we show that a locally adapted light-colored population of P. maniculatus living on the Nebraska Sand Hills shows an up-regulation of a single Agouti isoform, termed 1C, compared to their ancestral dark-colored conspecifics. Using in vitro assays, we show that this preference for isoform 1C may be driven by isoform-specific differences in translation. In addition, using an admixed population of wild-caught mice, we find that variation in overall Agouti expression maps to a region near exon 1C, which also has patterns of nucleotide variation consistent with strong positive selection. Finally, we show that the independent evolution of cryptic light pigmentation in a different species, P. polionotus, has been driven by a preference for the same Agouti isoform. Together, these findings present an example of the role of alternative transcript processing in adaptation and demonstrate molecular convergence at the level of isoform regulation.

27042423|t|Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors combination therapy in type 2 diabetes: A systematic review of current evidence.
27042423|a|As type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic and progressive disease with multiple pathophysiologic defects, no single anti-diabetic agent can tackle all these multi-factorial pathways. Consequently, multiple agents working through the different mechanisms will be required for the optimal glycemic control. Moreover, the combination therapies of different anti-diabetic agents may complement their actions and possibly act synergistic. Furthermore, these combinations could possess the additional properties to counter their undesired physiological compensatory response. Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2I) are newly emerging class of drugs, with a great potential to reduce glucose effectively with an additional quality of lowering cardiovascular events as demonstrated very recently by one of the agents of this class. However, increase in endogenous glucose production (EGP) from the liver, either due to the increase in glucagon or compensatory response to glucosuria can offset the glucose-lowering potential of SGLT-2I. Interestingly, another class of drugs such as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4I) effectively decrease glucagon and reduce EGP. In light of these findings, combination therapies with SGLT-2I and DPP-4I are particularly appealing and are expected to produce a synergistic effect. Preclinical studies of combination therapies with DPP-4I and SGLT-2I have already demonstrated a significant lowering of hemoglobin A1c potential and human studies also find no drug-drug interaction between these agents. This article aims to systematically review the efficacy and safety of combination therapy of SGLT-2I and DPP-4I in T2DM.

27061843|a|UNASSIGNED: New heteroatom polyoxovanadates (POVs) are synthesized applying a water soluble high nuclearity cluster as new synthon. The [V15Sb6O42]6- cluster shell exhibiting D3 symmetry is in-situ transformed into completely different cluster shells, namely the a-[V14Sb8O42]4- isomer with D2d and the b-[V14Sb8O42]4- isomer with D2h symmetry. The solvothermal reaction of {Ni(en)3}3[V15Sb6O42(H2O)x]    15H2O (en = ethylenediamine; x = 0 or 1) in water afforded crystallization of [{Ni(en)2}2V14Sb8O42]  nH2O containing the b-isomer. The addition of [Ni(phen)3](ClO4)2   0.5H2O (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline) to the reaction slurry yielded the new compound {Ni(phen)3}2[V14Sb8O42]   phen   12H2O with the a-isomer. Both transformation reactions are complex due the change of symmetry, the chemical composition and rearrangement of the VO5 square pyramids and Sb2O5 handle-like moieties.

27027065|t|BAKER'S CYST.
27027065|a|Baker's cysts are located in the posteromedial region of the knee between the medial belly of the gastrocnemius muscle and semimembranosus tendon. In adults, these cysts are related to intra-articular lesions, which may consist of meniscal lesions or arthrosis. In children, these cysts are usually found on physical examination or imaging studies, and they generally do not have any clinical relevance. Ultrasound examination is appropriate for identifying and measuring the popliteal cyst. The main treatment approach should focus on the joint lesions, and in most cases there is no need to address the cyst directly. Although almost all knee cysts are benign (Baker's cysts and parameniscal cysts), presence of some signs makes it necessary to suspect malignancy: symptoms disproportionate to the size of the cyst, absence of joint damage (e.g. meniscal tears) that might explain the existence of the cyst, unusual cyst topography, bone erosion, cyst size greater than 5 cm and tissue invasion (joint capsule).

27106045|t|Dysfunction of the bII spectrin-based pathway in human heart failure.
27106045|a|UNASSIGNED: bII spectrin is critical for integrating membrane and cytoskeletal domains in excitable and non-excitable cells. The role of bII spectrin for vertebrate function is illustrated by dysfunction of bII spectrin-based pathways in disease. Recently, defects in bII spectrin association with protein partner ankyrin-B were identified in congenital forms of human arrhythmia. However, the role of bII spectrin in common forms of acquired heart failure and arrhythmia is unknown. We report that bII spectrin protein levels are significantly altered in human cardiovascular disease as well as in large and small animal cardiovascular disease models. Specifically, bII spectrin levels were decreased in atrial samples of patients with atrial fibrillation compared with tissue from patients in sinus rhythm. Further, compared with left ventricular samples from non-failing hearts, bII spectrin levels were significantly decreased in left ventricle of ischemic- and non-ischemic heart failure patients. Left ventricle samples of canine and murine heart failure models confirm reduced bII spectrin protein levels. Mechanistically, we identify that bII spectrin levels are tightly regulated by post-translational mechanisms, namely calcium- and calpain-dependent proteases. Furthermore, consistent with this data, we observed Ca(2+)- and calpain-dependent loss of bII spectrin downstream effector proteins including ankyrin-B in heart. In summary, our findings illustrate that bII spectrin and downstream molecules are regulated in multiple forms of cardiovascular disease via Ca(2+)- and calpain-dependent proteolysis.

27105856|t|Quantifying the Subharmonic Mucosal Wave in Excised Larynges via Digital Kymography.
27105856|a|OBJECTIVES: In this paper, a nonlinear least squares fitting method was proposed to quantify subharmonic mucosal waves. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Subharmonic mucosal waves from 10 excised canine larynges were recorded using digital kymography and analyzed using nonlinear least squares and linear least squares methods. Amplitudes of fundamental and subharmonic mucosal wave components of right-upper, right-lower, left-upper, and left-lower vocal fold lips were calculated. Lastly, phase differences of fundamental and subharmonic components of the left and right vocal folds were compared. RESULTS: The results showed that the nonlinear least squares analysis method provides a more effective complement to the linear fitting method for subharmonic mucosal wave extraction. There was a significant difference in amplitudes between the subharmonic and the fundamental components of mucosal waves (P   <   0.05). The phase differences of the fundamental and the subharmonic components of the right and left vocal folds were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: The application of the nonlinear least squares analysis method in digital kymography is useful for the characterization of subharmonic mucosal waves.

27105172|t|Investigating associations of cyclooxygenase-2 expression with angiogenesis, proliferation, macrophage and T-lymphocyte infiltration in canine melanocytic tumours.
27105172|a|UNASSIGNED: Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is known to be involved in tumour progression and has been suggested as a therapeutic target in many human and animal malignancies. A number of different pathways subjacent to cancer hallmarks are considered to be involved in COX-2-mediated tumour progression, although these are still largely undefined. Our aim is to investigate associations between COX-2 expression and angiogenesis, proliferation and the inflammatory microenvironment in canine melanocytic tumours. Understanding the involvement of COX-2 with cancer hallmarks might enable us to adapt therapeutic strategies for canine melanomas, an aggressive and often lethal malignancy with value in comparative oncology. Immunohistochemical staining of COX-2, Ki-67 (proliferation index), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), factor VIII (microvessel density), CD3 (lymphocytes) and MAC387 (macrophages) was performed in 51 melanocytic tumours (31 malignant melanomas, 20 melanocytomas). Statistical associations between COX-2 and the other parameters detected were analysed. In melanocytic tumours (n=51), both COX-2 labelling extension and intensity showed a statistically significant association with angiogenesis by factor VIII, VEGF, Ki-67, CD3+ T lymphocytes and MAC387. Within malignant melanomas, COX-2 expression has shown significant associations with microvessel density (factor VIII), lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration and, considering all melanocytic tumours, COX-2 was also associated with VEGF intensity and Ki-67 cell proliferation. Our results point to a role for COX-2 in angiogenesis and in the establishment of an inflammatory microenvironment, favourable to melanoma tumour progression. Further mechanistic studies are warranted to dissect molecular pathways in which COX-2 is involved. Present evidence suggests that COX-2 inhibitors might be useful as an adjuvant treatment to hinder canine melanoma progression.

27086786|a|UNASSIGNED: The use of natural products for the treatment of disease is one of the oldest cultures that exists. Currently, the research of new drugs using natural products shows a poorly explored biodiversity and a great interest of marketing. The enzymatic inhibition by some natural products investigated among these is the inhibition of hyaluronidase and the consequent reduction of the degradation of hyaluronic acid. So there is a reduction of inflammation and angiogenesis. This study reports the main natural species studied in inhibiting human hyaluronidase that can be the subject of future research for new drugs.

27094442|t|Coupling Satellite Data with Species Distribution and Connectivity Models as a Tool for Environmental Management and Planning in Matrix-Sensitive Species.
27094442|a|UNASSIGNED: Climate change and anthropogenic habitat fragmentation are considered major threats for global biodiversity. As a direct consequence, connectivity is increasingly disrupted in many species, which might have serious consequences that could ultimately lead to the extinction of populations. Although a large number of reserves and conservation sites are designated and protected by law, potential habitats acting as inter-population connectivity corridors are, however, mostly ignored in the common practice of environmental planning. In most cases, this is mainly caused by a lack of quantitative measures of functional connectivity available for the planning process. In this study, we highlight the use of fine-scale potential connectivity models (PCMs) derived from multispectral satellite data for the quantification of spatially explicit habitat corridors for matrix-sensitive species of conservation concern. This framework couples a species distribution model with a connectivity model in a two-step framework, where suitability maps from step 1 are transformed into maps of landscape resistance in step 2 filtered by fragmentation thresholds. We illustrate the approach using the sand lizard (Lacerta agilis L.) in the metropolitan area of Cologne, Germany, as a case study. Our model proved to be well suited to identify connected as well as completely isolated populations within the study area. Furthermore, due to its fine resolution, the PCM was also able to detect small linear structures known to be important for sand lizards' inter-population connectivity such as railroad embankments. We discuss the applicability and possible implementation of PCMs to overcome shortcomings in the common practice of environmental impact assessments.

27055658|t|Modeling Refuge Effect of Submerged Macrophytes in Lake System.
27055658|a|UNASSIGNED: This paper considers a significant problem in biological control of algae issue in ecological environment. A four-dimensional dynamic model is carefully formulated to characterize the interactions among phytoplankton, submerged macrophyte, zooplankton, and general fish class in a lake ecosystem. The predation relationship is modeled by Beddington-DeAngelis functional responses derived from the classical Holling time budget arguments. Qualitative analyses of the global dynamics show that the system can generate very rich dynamics with potentially 10 different equilibria and several bistable scenarios. We perform analysis on the existence and local stability of equilibria and explore the refuge effect of macrophyte on the zooplankton with numerical simulations on aquatic ecosystems. We also discuss effective methods of biological control used to restrain the increase of phytoplankton. Our study shows the proposed model could have rich and complex dynamics including but not limited to bistable and chaotic phenomenon. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that both the refuge constant and the density of the macrophytes are two key factors where refuge effects take place. In addition, the intraspecific competition between the macrophyte and the phytoplankton can also affect the macrophyte's refuge effect. Our analytical and simulation results suggest that macrophytes provide structure and shelter against predation for zooplankton such that it could restore the zooplankton population, and that planting macrophyte properly might achieve the purpose of controlling algae growth.

27082742|t|Assessing Regional-Scale Impacts of Short Rotation Coppices on Ecosystem Services by Modeling Land-Use Decisions.
27082742|a|UNASSIGNED: Meeting the world's growing energy demand through bioenergy production involves extensive land-use change which could have severe environmental and social impacts. Second generation bioenergy feedstocks offer a possible solution to this problem. They have the potential to reduce land-use conflicts between food and bioenergy production as they can be grown on low quality land not suitable for food production. However, a comprehensive impact assessment that considers multiple ecosystem services (ESS) and biodiversity is needed to identify the environmentally best feedstock option, as trade-offs are inherent. In this study, we simulate the spatial distribution of short rotation coppices (SRCs) in the landscape of the Mulde watershed in Central Germany by modeling profit-maximizing farmers under different economic and policy-driven scenarios using a spatially explicit economic simulation model. This allows to derive general insights and a mechanistic understanding of regional-scale impacts on multiple ESS in the absence of large-scale implementation. The modeled distribution of SRCs, required to meet the regional demand of combined heat and power (CHP) plants for solid biomass, had little or no effect on the provided ESS. In the policy-driven scenario, placing SRCs on low or high quality soils to provide ecological focus areas, as required within the Common Agricultural Policy in the EU, had little effect on ESS. Only a substantial increase in the SRC production area, beyond the regional demand of CHP plants, had a relevant effect, namely a negative impact on food production as well as a positive impact on biodiversity and regulating ESS. Beneficial impacts occurred for single ESS. However, the number of sites with balanced ESS supply hardly increased due to larger shares of SRCs in the landscape. Regression analyses showed that the occurrence of sites with balanced ESS supply was more strongly driven by biophysical factors than by the SRC share in the landscape. This indicates that SRCs negligibly affect trade-offs between individual ESS. Coupling spatially explicit economic simulation models with environmental and ESS assessment models can contribute to a comprehensive impact assessment of bioenergy feedstocks that have not yet been planted.

27045096|a|UNASSIGNED: Feeding on the blood of vertebrates is a risky task for haematophagous insects and it can be reasonably assumed that it should also be costly in terms of energetic expenditure. Blood circulates inside vessels and it must be pumped through narrow tubular stylets to be ingested. We analysed the respiratory pattern and the energetic cost of taking a blood meal inRhodnius prolixususing flow-through and stop-flow respirometry, for measuring carbon dioxide emission, oxygen consumption and water loss before and during feeding. We observed an increase of up to 17-fold in the metabolic rate during feeding and a change in the respiratory pattern, which switched from discontinuous cyclic during resting, to continuous when the insects started to feed, remaining this condition unchanged for several hours. The energetic cost of taking a meal was significantly higher when bugs fed on a living host, compared to feeding on an artificial feeder. No differences were observed between feeding on blood or on saline solutionin vitro, revealing that the responsible for such difference in the energetic cost was the substrate for feeding (vessels vs. membrane) and not the nature of the fluid. Water loss significantly increased during feeding, but did not vary with the feeding method or the type of food. The mean respiratory quotient (RQ) in resting bugs was 0.83, decreasing during feeding to 0.52. These data constitute the first metabolic measures of an insect during blood feeding and provide the first insights on the energetic expenditure associated to haematophagy.

27081787|t|Non-Absorbable Disaccharides for Hepatic Encephalopathy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
27081787|a|UNASSIGNED: Non-absorbable disaccharides (NADs) have been used to treat hepatic encephalopathy (HE) since 1966. However, a Cochrane review, published in 2004, found insufficient evidence to recommend their use in this context. This updated systematic review evaluates the effects of the NADs, lactulose and lactitol, for the treatment and prevention of HE in patients with cirrhosis. Thirty-eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs), involving 1828 patients, were identified via electronic and manual searches; 31 RCTs looked at the treatment of HE while seven looked at its primary/secondary prevention. Random-effects meta-analyses showed that, compared to placebo/no intervention, NADs had a beneficial effect on HE (relative risk [RR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53-0.74; Number Needed to Treat [NNT] = 4) and serious liver-related adverse events such as: liver failure, variceal bleeding, serious infections, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome (RR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.26-0.69; NNT = 50). Treatment was also associated with a reduction in mortality in patients with overt HE (RR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.14-0.94; NNT = 20), although not in patients with minimal HE. Meta-analyses of the prevention RCTs showed that NADs prevented the development of HE (RR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.33-0.68; NNT = 6), the risk of developing serious liver-related adverse events (RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.33-0.70; NNT = 6), and reduced mortality (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.40-0.98; NNT = 20). Use of NADs was associated with non-serious gastrointestinal adverse events. There were no differences in the efficacy or safety of lactulose and lactitol. CONCLUSIONS: NADs have beneficial effects in the treatment and prevention of HE; their use, in this context, confers additional benefits including a reduction in serious liver-related morbidities and all-cause mortality.

27040154|t|Effects of carnosine supplementation on glucose metabolism: Pilot clinical trial.
27040154|a|OBJECTIVE: Carnosine is a naturally present dipeptide in humans and an over-the counter food additive. Evidence from animal studies supports the role for carnosine in the prevention and treatment of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, yet there is limited human data. This study investigated whether carnosine supplementation in individuals with overweight or obesity improves diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors. METHODS: In a double-blind randomized pilot trial in nondiabetic individuals with overweight and obesity (age 43        8 years; body mass index 31        4 kg/m(2) ), 15 individuals were randomly assigned to 2 g carnosine daily and 15 individuals to placebo for 12 weeks. Insulin sensitivity and secretion, glucose tolerance (oral glucose tolerance test), blood pressure, plasma lipid profile, skeletal muscle ((1) H-MRS), and urinary carnosine levels were measured. RESULTS: Carnosine concentrations increased in urine after supplementation (P   <   0.05). An increase in fasting insulin and insulin resistance was hampered in individuals receiving carnosine compared to placebo, and this remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, and change in body weight (P   =   0.02, P   =   0.04, respectively). Two-hour glucose and insulin were both lower after carnosine supplementation compared to placebo in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (P   <   0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These pilot intervention data suggest that carnosine supplementation may be an effective strategy for prevention of type 2 diabetes.

27096721|t|User-centered Design of the eyeGuide: A Tailored Glaucoma Behavior Change Program.
27096721|a|PURPOSE: We employed user-centered design to refine a prototype of the eyeGuide, a novel, tailored behavior change program intended to improve medication adherence among glaucoma patients. PATIENTS: Glaucoma patients age 40 years and above prescribed >= 1 glaucoma medication were included. METHODS: The eyeGuide consists of tailored educational content and tailored testimonials in which patients share how they were able to overcome barriers to improve their medication adherence. A hybrid of semistructured diagnostic and pretesting interviews were used to refine the content of the eyeGuide. Purposeful sampling was used to recruit a study population representative of the glaucoma patient population. Interviews were conducted until thematic saturation was reached. Interviews were audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim. Three researchers analyzed the transcripts, generated a codebook, and identified key themes using NVivo 10.0 to further refine the eyeGuide. RESULTS: Twenty-one glaucoma patients were interviewed; mean age 72  12.4 years, 5 (24%) African Americans, 9 (43%) with poor self-reported adherence, 10 (47.6%) age 75 years and above, 10 (47.6%) with poor vision, and 9 (42.9%) women. Qualitative analysis identified 5 important themes for improving glaucoma self-management: social support, patient-provider relationship, medication routine, patients' beliefs about disease and treatment, and eye drop instillation. All participants expressed satisfaction with in-person delivery of the eyeGuide and preferred this to a Web-based module. Participant feedback resulted in revised content. CONCLUSIONS: User-centered design generated improvements in the eyeGuide that would not have been possible without patient input. Participants expressed satisfaction with the tailored content.

27079867|t|A comparative assessment of the cytotoxicity and nitric oxide reducing ability of resveratrol, pterostilbene and piceatannol in transformed and normal mouse macrophages.
27079867|a|UNASSIGNED: The present study investigated the pharmacological effects of three stilbenoids, resveratrol (RES), pterostilbene (PTR) and piceatannol (PIC), in transformed and normal macrophages. Our first aim was to comparatively assess the cytotoxicity of RES, PTR and PIC in unstimulated transformed mouse macrophages (RAW 264.7 cells) and primary peritoneal macrophages (PMs) harvested from both wild type and Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2)-deficient female mice. Our second aim was to investigate whether the inhibitory effect of RES, PTR and PIC on nitric oxide (NO) release from stimulated PMs depends on the status of the transcription factor Nrf2. The rationale for investigating Nrf2 status was based upon recent reports showing that certain compounds (sulforaphane and linalool) suppress LPS-induced inflammation in an Nrf2-dependent manner. Cell viability studies confirmed our prior work in unstimulated RAW 264.7 cells, with cytotoxic potency decreasing in the order of PTR   >   PIC   >   RES. Unstimulated PMs, regardless of Nrf2 status, were less sensitive to stilbenes, requiring at least a threefold higher stilbene concentration to inhibit cell viability, with cytotoxic potency again decreasing in the order of PTR   >   PIC   >   RES. In studies focused on our second aim, IC50 values for NO inhibition (measured as [Formula: see text]) in wild type PMs were similar for all three stilbenes (   10    M). In Nrf2-deficient PMs, the IC50 for NO inhibition by PIC did not change; however, a rightward shift in the concentration effect curve was observed for both RES and PTR, indicating a role for Nrf2 in the suppression of LPS-induced [Formula: see text] accumulation by these particular stilbenes.

27102275|t|Effect of coating on the environmental applications of zero valent iron nanoparticles: the lindane case.
27102275|a|UNASSIGNED: Commercial stabilized slurry of zero-valent iron nanoparticles (nZVI) as well as laboratory-synthesized polymer-stabilized NZVI nanoparticles were used for lindane (y-hexachlorocyclohexane) degradation studies in aqueous solution. In the present study, polymer-stabilized iron nanoparticles were stabilized using polyethylene glycol (PEG, Mn ~400 and ~950-1050) and polytetrahydrofuran (PTHF, Mn ~650). To study the effectiveness of the different nanoparticles, a quantitative monitorization of lindane degradation by using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and a qualitative measurement of generated volatile by-products by headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) followed by GC/MS were carried out. The obtained data were compared and contrasted with the results obtained in previous work. Results showed that the nanoparticles studied in this work possess superior dechlorination performance compared with previous observations. The freshly prepared Fe(0)-PEG400, Fe(0)-PEG1050 and Fe(0)-PTHF exhibited high reactivity during the dechlorination process of lindane in a very short time. The results obtained with the synthesized nanoparticles were similar to those obtained with commercial nanoparticles. However, in all cases reactivity decreased at reaction's late stage. Degradation of lindane by the studied nanoparticles removed 99.9% of the lindane initial concentration after 72h, except for Fe(0)-PTHF nanoparticles, for which the reaction stopped after 5min. In all cases, the reaction followed a second order kinetics. Finally, comparing the results from this study with our previous work, where different nature polymers were considered (Fe(0)-CMC, Fe(0)-PAA and Fe(0)-PAP), more gradual degradation profile of lindane was observed for Fe(0)-PAA and Fe(0)-CMC. It should be noted that in the present case, the reaction of lindane was speeded up with commercial and Fe(0)-PEG nanoparticles. Nevertheless, in the later case, the composition of by-products was affected by the presence of partially degraded intermediates. Taking into account the current technologies, the high removal rates obtained and the acceptable degradation times required, the proposed technology is suitable for its aimed purpose.

27072837|t|Catheter manipulation analysis for objective performance and technical skills assessment in transcatheter aortic valve implantation.
27072837|a|PURPOSE: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) demands precise and efficient handling of surgical instruments within the confines of the aortic anatomy. Operational performance and dexterous skills are critical for patient safety, and objective methods are assessed with a number of manipulation features, derived from the kinematic analysis of the catheter/guidewire in fluoroscopy video sequences. METHODS: A silicon phantom model of a type I aortic arch was used for this study. Twelve endovascular surgeons, divided into two experience groups, experts ([Formula: see text]) and novices ([Formula: see text]), performed cannulation of the aorta, representative of valve placement in TAVI. Each participant completed two TAVI experiments, one with conventional catheters and one with the Magellan robotic platform. Video sequences of the fluoroscopic monitor were recorded for procedural processing. A semi-automated tracking software provided the 2D coordinates of the catheter/guidewire tip. In addition, the aorta phantom was segmented in the videos and the shape of the entire catheter was manually annotated in a subset of the available video frames using crowdsourcing. The TAVI procedure was divided into two stages, and various metrics, representative of the catheter's overall navigation as well as its relative movement to the vessel wall, were developed. RESULTS: Experts consistently exhibited lower values of procedure time and dimensionless jerk, and higher average speed and acceleration than novices. Robotic navigation resulted in increased average distance to the vessel wall in both groups, a surrogate measure of safety and reduced risk of embolisation. Discrimination of experience level and types of equipment was achieved with the generated motion features and established clustering algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of surgical skills is possible through the analysis of the catheter/guidewire motion pattern. The use of robotic endovascular platforms seems to enable more precise and controlled catheter navigation.

27012476|t|A statewide teleradiology system reduces radiation exposure and charges in transferred trauma patients.
27012476|a|BACKGROUND: Trauma transfer patients routinely undergo repeat imaging because of inefficiencies within the radiology system. In 2009, the virtual private network (VPN) telemedicine system was adopted throughout Oregon allowing virtual image transfer between hospitals. The startup cost was a nominal  3,000 per hospital. METHODS: A retrospective review from 2007 to 2012 included 400 randomly selected adult trauma transfer patients based on a power analysis (200 pre/200 post). The primary outcome evaluated was reduction in repeat computed tomography (CT) scans. Secondary outcomes included cost savings, emergency department (ED) length of stay (LOS), and spared radiation. All data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests. P less than .05 indicated significance. Spared radiation was calculated as a weighted average per body region, and savings was calculated using charges obtained from Oregon Health and Science University radiology current procedural terminology codes. RESULTS: Four-hundred patients were included. Injury Severity Score, age, ED and overall LOS, mortality, trauma type, and gender were not statistically different between groups. The percentage of patients with repeat CT scans decreased after VPN implementation: CT abdomen (13.2% vs 2.8%, P < .01) and cervical spine (34.4% vs 18.2%, P < .01). Post-VPN, the total charges saved in 2012 for trauma transfer patients was  333,500, whereas the average radiation dose spared per person was 1.8 mSV. Length of stay in the ED for patients with Injury Severity Score less than 15 transferring to the ICU was decreased (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a statewide teleradiology network resulted in fewer total repeat CT scans, significant savings, decrease in radiation exposure, and decreased LOS in the ED for patients with less complex injuries. The potential for health care savings by widespread adoption of a VPN is significant.

27015103|t|The geometric curvature of the lumbar spine during restricted and unrestricted squats.
27015103|a|BACKGROUND: The main purpose of this study was to analyse the behaviour of the geometric curvature of the lumbar spine during restricted and unrestricted squats, using a novel investigative method. The rationale for our hypothesis is that the lumbar curvature has different patterns at different spine levels depending on the squat technique used. METHODS: Spine motion was collected via stereo-photogrammetric analysis in nineteen participants (11 males, 8 females). The reconstructed spine points at the upright neutral position and at the deepest position of the squat exercise were projected onto the sagittal plane of the trunk, a polynomial was fitted to the data, and were quantified the two-dimensional geometric curvature at lower, central and higher lumbar levels, besides the inclination of trunk and lumbosacral region, the overall geometric curvature and overall angle of the lumbar spine. The mean values for each variable were analysed with paired t-test (P<0.05). RESULTS: The lumbar presents a flexion from upright neutral posture to deepest point of the movement, but for the lower lumbar the flexion is less intense if the knees travel anteriorly past the toes. The trunk and the lumbosacral region lean forward in both squat techniques and these effects are also reduced in unrestricted squats. CONCLUSION: The data collected in the study are evidence that during barbell squats the lumbar curvature has different patterns at different spinal levels depending on the exercise technique. The lower lumbar spine appears to be less overloaded during unrestricted squats.

27002492|t|Electromechanically Tunable Suspended Optical Nanoantenna.
27002492|a|UNASSIGNED: Coupling mechanical degrees of freedom with plasmonic resonances has potential applications in optomechanics, sensing, and active plasmonics. Here we demonstrate a suspended two-wire plasmonic nanoantenna acting like a nanoelectrometer. The antenna wires are supported and electrically connected via thin leads without disturbing the antenna resonance. As a voltage is applied, equal charges are induced on both antenna wires. The resulting equilibrium between the repulsive Coulomb force and the restoring elastic bending force enables us to precisely control the gap size. As a result the resonance wavelength and the field enhancement of the suspended optical nanoantenna can be reversibly tuned. Our experiments highlight the potential to realize large bandwidth optical nanoelectromechanical systems.

27011745|t|Effect of at-home bleaching with different thickeners and aging on physical properties of a nanocomposite.
27011745|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of 16% carbamide peroxide (CP) containing different thickeners on the physical characteristics of a nanocomposite resin submitted or not to accelerated artificial aging (AAA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred samples were randomly distributed into two groups (n = 50) according to AAA. Each group was divided into 5 subgroups (n = 10) depending on the bleaching/thickener treatment: CP + carbopol, CP + natrosol, carbopol, natrosol, and no treatment (control). The physical properties tested were color (  E), gloss (GU), mean roughness (Ra), and Knoop microhardness (KHN). The resin surface was performed with atomic force microscopy (AFM). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The color (variable    E) was assessed with two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and additionally with Tukey's and Dunnett's tests, the roughness values were submitted to Kruskal-Wallis, Dunn's, and Mann-Whitney's tests. Data on gloss and KHN were submitted to two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (a = 0.05). RESULTS: Among the physical properties evaluated, CP + carbopol promoted a reduction in composite microhardness only, thus differing statistically from the controls. As for CP + natrosol, such a change was not observed. The aging process reduced all the physical properties, thus differing statistically from the nonaging group. CP + carbopol increased the roughness and decreased the gloss of aged resins, whereas natrosol reduced gloss only, which differed statistically from the controls. CONCLUSIONS: AFM showed evidence of the loss of organic matrix and exposure to load particles in the aged samples. Therefore, the replacement of carbopol with natrosol provided maintenance of the composite microhardness following bleaching. The aging process reduced the physical properties evaluated, and some changes were enhanced by the application of bleaching.

27090360|t|Sex differences in renin response and changes of capillary diameters after renal ischemia/reperfusion injury.
27090360|a|UNASSIGNED: Activation of the RAS has a crucial role in the progression of ischemia/reperfusion-associated CAD. The regulation of RAS differs in the two genders. However, the extent of gender differences and locations of renin production have not been revealed yet. We investigated in vivo the local renin production in the two genders during ischemia/reperfusion injury. In male and female Wistar rats, renal ischemia was induced followed by a reperfusion period of two, eight, 16, 24, or 48 h. We applied flow cytometry to measure renin content and multiphoton imaging to visualize renin granules and changes of peritubular diameters in vivo during ischemia/reperfusion. Renin content decreased in CD in the first eight h of reperfusion; however, after 16 h, its amount increased. In males, the production of renin was more pronounced, and the duration of vasoconstriction was longer with a subsequent phase of vessel hyperdilation compared to females. Renal ischemia/reperfusion injury induces renin response not only in the JGA, but also in the CD segment. Renin production is more explicit in males than in females which, via increased angiotensin II production, might explain the different dynamism of renal vessel regulation between the two genders.

27028074|t|Estimating Effects of Species Interactions on Populations of Endangered Species.
27028074|a|UNASSIGNED: Global change causes community composition to change considerably through time, with ever-new combinations of interacting species. To study the consequences of newly established species interactions, one available source of data could be observational surveys from biodiversity monitoring. However, approaches using observational data would need to account for niche differences between species and for imperfect detection of individuals. To estimate population sizes of interacting species, we extended N-mixture models that were developed to estimate true population sizes in single species. Simulations revealed that our model is able to disentangle direct effects of dominant on subordinate species from indirect effects of dominant species on detection probability of subordinate species. For illustration, we applied our model to data from a Swiss amphibian monitoring program and showed that sizes of expanding water frog populations were negatively related to population sizes of endangered yellow-bellied toads and common midwife toads and partly of natterjack toads. Unlike other studies that analyzed presence and absence of species, our model suggests that the spread of water frogs in Central Europe is one of the reasons for the decline of endangered toad species. Thus, studying population impacts of dominant species on population sizes of endangered species using data from biodiversity monitoring programs should help to inform conservation policy and to decide whether competing species should be subject to population management.

27026120|t|Prediction of Lunar- and Martian-Based Intra- and Site-to-Site Task Performance.
27026120|a|BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of determining the physiological parameters associated with the ability to complete simulated exploration type tasks at metabolic rates which might be expected for lunar and Martian ambulation. METHODS: Running Vo2max and gas exchange threshold (GET) were measured in 21 volunteers. Two simulated extravehicular activity field tests were completed in 1 G in regular athletic apparel at two intensities designed to elicit metabolic rates of    20.0 and    30.0 ml    kg(-1)    min(-1), which are similar to those previously reported for ambulation in simulated lunar- and Martian-based environments, respectively. RESULTS: All subjects were able to complete the field test at the lunar intensity, but 28% were unable to complete the field test at the Martian intensity (non-Finishers). During the Martian field test there were no differences in Vo2 between Finishers and non-Finishers, but the non-Finishers achieved a greater %Vo2max compared to Finishers (78.4    4.6% vs. 64.9    9.6%). Logistic regression analysis revealed fitness thresholds for a predicted probability of 0.5, at which Finishing and non-Finishing are equally likely, and 0.75, at which an individual has a 75% chance of Finishing, to be a Vo2max of 38.4 ml    kg(-1)    min(-1) and 40.0 ml    kg(-1)    min(-1) or a GET of 20.1 ml    kg(-1)    min(-1) and 25.1 ml    kg(-1)    min(-1), respectively (  (2) = 10.2). Logistic regression analysis also revealed that the expected %Vo2max required to complete a field test could be used to successfully predict performance (  (2) = 19.3). DISCUSSION: The results of the present investigation highlight the potential utility of Vo2max, particularly as it relates to the metabolic demands of a surface ambulation, in defining successful completion of planetary-based exploration field tests.

27048165|t|An Overview on Bacteriophages: A Natural Nanostructured Antibacterial Agent.
27048165|a|BACKGROUND: Recent advances in the field of bionanomedicine make us not only to produce biomaterials but also to manipulate them at molecular level. Viruses particularly bacteriophages are a promising nanomaterial that can be functionalized with great precision. Bacteriophages are the natural antimicrobial agents that    ght against antibiotic resistant bacteria which causes infections in animals, in humans, or in crops of agricultural value. OBJECTIVE: The idea of utilizing bacteriophages as therapeutic agents is due to their ability to kill bacteria at the end of the infectious cycle. This paper reviewed on the general biology of bacteriophages, presence of receptors on the bacteria which are necessary for the recognition and adsorption of bacteriophages. Pharmacokinetics and therapeutic potential of bacteriophages administered through various routes in treating diverse bacterial infections is also reviewed along with the problems associated with bacteriophage therapy. CONCLUSION: By engineering the phages or by making a cocktail of phages it would become easy to treat various bacterial infections which are as such resistant to the current generations of antibiotics available in the market. Among various routes of administration parenteral route is found to be the most thriving route for the treatment of systemic infections whereas oral route is meant to treat gastrointestinal infections whereas; local delivery (skin, nasal, ears) of phages has proven their potency to treat topical infections.

27009370|t|The retinoid X receptor from mud crab: new insights into its roles in ovarian development and related signaling pathway.
27009370|a|In arthropods, retinoid X receptor (RXR) is a highly conserved nuclear hormone receptor. By forming a heterodimeric complex with the ecdysone receptor (EcR), RXR is known to be vital importance for various physiological processes. However, in comparison to EcR, the RXR signaling pathway and its roles in crustacean reproduction are poorly understood. In the present study, the RXR mRNA was detected in the ovarian follicular cells of mud crab Scylla paramamosain (SpRXR) and during ovarian maturation, its expression level was found to increase significantly. In vitro experiment showed that both SpRXR and vitellogenin (SpVg) mRNA in the ovarian explants were significantly induced by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) but not methyl farnesoate (MF). However, differing from the in vitro experiment, injection of MF in in vivo experiment significantly stimulated the expressions of SpRXR and SpVg in female crabs at early vitellogenic stage, but the ecdysone and insect juvenile hormone (JH) signaling pathway genes were not induced. The results together suggest that both MF and SpRXR play significant roles in regulating the expression of SpVg and ovarian development of S. paramamosain through their own specific signaling pathway rather than sharing with the ecdysone or the insect JH.

27091339|t|Liposome size and charge optimization for intraarterial delivery to gliomas.
27091339|a|UNASSIGNED: Nanoparticles such as liposomes may be used as drug delivery vehicles for brain tumor therapy. Particle geometry and electrostatic properties have been hypothesized to be important determinants of effective tumor targeting after intraarterial injection. In this study, we investigate the combined roles of liposome size and surface charge on the effectiveness of delivery to gliomas after intraarterial injection. Intracarotid injection of liposomes was performed in separate cohorts of both healthy and C6 glioma-bearing Sprague Dawley rats after induction of transient cerebral hypoperfusion. Large (200  nm) and small (60-80  nm) fluorescent dye-loaded liposomes that were either cationic or neutral in surface charge were utilized. Delivery effectiveness was quantitatively measured both with real-time, in vivo and postmortem diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Semi-quantitative multispectral fluorescence imaging was also utilized to assess the pattern and extent of liposome targeting within tumors. Large cationic liposomes demonstrated the most effective hemispheric and glioma targeting of all the liposomes tested. Selective large cationic liposome retention at the site of glioma growth was observed. The liposome deposition pattern within tumors after intraarterial injection was variable with both core penetration and peripheral deposition observed in specific tumors. This study provides evidence that liposome size and charge are important determinants of effective brain and glioma targeting after intraarterial injection. Our results support the future development of 200-nm cationic liposomal formulations of candidate intraarterial anti-glioma agents for further pre-clinical testing.

27064930|t|On the Gaussian approximation in colloidal hard sphere fluids.
27064930|a|UNASSIGNED: We study the behaviour of the self-intermediate scattering function and self-van Hove correlation function for quasi-two-dimensional colloidal hard sphere fluids at a range of area fractions. We compute these functions first directly from the particle coordinates and secondly from the mean squared displacement via the Gaussian approximation. This allows us to test the validity of this approximation over a range of length and time scales, where we find that the Gaussian approximation holds if the hydrodynamic limits are appropriately probed. Surprisingly, only small deviations from Gaussian behaviour are seen at intermediate times, even for dense fluids. We next consider these deviations from Gaussian behaviour firstly via the non-Gaussian parameter and secondly by considering the relaxation times of the intermediate scattering function. From these measurements we develop a scaling relation in order to directly determine the combinations of wavevectors and times at which the non-Gaussian behavior is seen. This allows for the clear identification of the hydrodynamic regimes and thus provides new insight into the crossover between long- and short-time self-diffusion.

27082965|t|Estimating Causal Effects of Long-Term PM2.5 Exposure on Mortality in New Jersey.
27082965|a|BACKGROUND: Many studies have reported the associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and increased risk of death. But, to our knowledge, none of them have used causal modeling approach or controlled for long-term temperature exposure. Few have used a general population sample. OBJECTIVE: We estimated the causal effects of long-term PM2.5 effect on mortality and tested the effect modifications by seasonal temperatures, census-tract-level socio-economic variables, and county-level health conditions. METHODS: We applied a variant of the difference-in-differences approach, which serves to approximate random assignment of exposure across the population and hence estimate a causal effect. Specifically, we estimated the association between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and mortality controlling for geographical differences using dummy variables for each census tract in New Jersey, a state-wide time trend using dummy variables for each year from 2004 to 2009, and mean summer and winter temperatures for each tract in each year. This approach assumed that no variable changing differentially over time across space other than seasonal temperatures confounded the association. RESULTS: For each interquartile range (2  g/m(3)) increase in annual PM2.5, there was a 3.0% (95% confidence interval: 0.2, 5.9%) increase in all natural cause mortality for the whole population, with similar results for people older than 65 [3.5% (0.1, 6.9%)] and people 65 or younger [3.1% (-1.8, 8.2%)]. Mean summer temperature and mean winter temperature in a census tract significantly modified the effect of long-term exposure to PM2.5 on mortality. We observed a higher percentage increase in mortality associated with PM2.5 in census tracts with more blacks, lower home value, or lower median income. CONCLUSIONS: Under the assumption of the difference-in-differences approach, we identified a causal effect of long-term PM2.5 on mortality which is modified by seasonal temperatures and ecological socio-economic status.

27014794|t|Donation After Circulatory Death for Liver Transplantation: A Meta-Analysis on the Location of Life Support Withdrawal Affecting Outcomes.
27014794|a|BACKGROUND: Liver transplantation using donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors is associated with inferior outcomes compared to donation after brain death (DBD). Prolonged donor warm ischemic time has been identified as the key factor responsible for this difference. Various aspects of the donor life support withdrawal procedure, including location of withdrawal and administration of antemortem heparin, are thought to play important roles in mitigating the effects of warm ischemia. However, a systematic exploration of these factors is important for more confident integration of these practices into a standard DCD protocol. METHODS: Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane libraries were systematically searched and 23 relevant studies identified for analysis. Donation after circulatory death recipients were stratified according to location of life support withdrawal (intensive care unit or operating theater) and use of antemortem heparin. RESULTS: Donation after circulatory death recipients had comparable 1-year patient survival to DBD recipients if the location of withdrawal of life support was the operating theater, but not if the location was the intensive care unit. Likewise, the inferior 1-year graft survival and higher incidence of ischemic cholangiopathy of DCD compared with DBD recipients were improved by withdrawal in operating theater, although higher rates of ischemic cholangiopathy and worse graft survival were still observed in DCD recipients. Furthermore, administering heparin before withdrawal of life support reduced the incidence of primary nonfunction of the allograft. CONCLUSIONS: Our evidence suggests that withdrawal in the operating theater and premortem heparin administration improve DCD liver transplant outcomes, thus allowing for the most effective usage of these valuable organs.

27015205|t|Risk of Nonarteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Following End-Stage Renal Disease.
27015205|a|UNASSIGNED: To investigate the risk of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) following end-stage renal disease (ESRD).A retrospective, nationwide, matched cohort study.ESRD patients identified by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code 585.The study cohort included 93,804 ESRD patients registered with the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database between January 2000 and December 2009. An age- and sex-matched control group comprised 93,804 patients (case:control=1:1) selected from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000. Information for each patient was collected from the index date until December 2011. The incidence and risk of NAION were compared between the ESRD and control groups. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for NAION after adjustment for potential confounders was obtained by a Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate the cumulative incidence rate of NAION.The incidence of NAION following ESRD.In total, 133 ESRD patients (0.14%) and 51 controls (0.05%) had NAION (P<0.001) during the follow-up period, leading to a significantly elevated risk of NAION in the ESRD patients compared with the controls (incidence rate ratio=3.14, 95% confidence interval [CI]=2.11-4.67). After adjustment for potential confounders including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypotension, hyperlipidemia, and 2-way interaction terms between any 2 factors, ESRD patients were 3.12 times more likely to develop NAION than non-ESRD patients in the full cohort (adjusted HR=3.12, 95% CI=2.10-4.64). Additionally, patients with hypertension and hyperlipidemia showed higher incidence rates of NAION in the ESRD group compared with the controls: 2.31 (95% CI=1.40-3.82) for hypertension and 2.72 (95% CI=1.14-6.50) for hyperlipidemia.ESRD increased the risk of NAION, which is an interdisciplinary emergency. Close collaboration between nephrologists and ophthalmologists is important in NAION management following ESRD to prevent fellow eye involvement.

27163711|t|Criminality and Sexual Behaviours in Substance Dependents Seeking Treatment.
27163711|a|UNASSIGNED: The aim of this study was to investigate the link between violence, crime, and sexual behavior among patients with substance-related disorder admitted to a specialized inpatient care unit. This was a cross-sectional study using a questionnaire on socio-demographic characteristics, drug of choice (DOC), questions about sexual behavior, and instruments to evaluate the severity of dependence (SADD, DAST, FTND), level of impulsivity (BIS-11), and a screening sex addiction scale. The sample consisted of 587 adult subjects, of which 82.3% were men, 66.4% had used cocaine (sniffed and smoked) as their DOC, 24.4% had a history with the criminal justice system, 26.8% had committed crimes, 19.3% had engaged in violent behavior, and 12.2% had been involved in drug trafficking. In this sample, crime was strongly associated with various sexual behaviors and the severity of substance dependence.

27163364|t|Mutation Processes in 293-Based Clones Overexpressing the DNA Cytosine Deaminase APOBEC3B.
27163364|a|UNASSIGNED: Molecular, cellular, and clinical studies have combined to demonstrate a contribution from the DNA cytosine deaminase APOBEC3B (A3B) to the overall mutation load in breast, head/neck, lung, bladder, cervical, ovarian, and other cancer types. However, the complete landscape of mutations attributable to this enzyme has yet to be determined in a controlled human cell system. We report a conditional and isogenic system for A3B induction, genomic DNA deamination, and mutagenesis. Human 293-derived cells were engineered to express doxycycline-inducible A3B-eGFP or eGFP constructs. Cells were subjected to 10 rounds of A3B-eGFP exposure that each caused 80-90% cell death. Control pools were subjected to parallel rounds of non-toxic eGFP exposure, and dilutions were done each round to mimic A3B-eGFP induced population fluctuations. Targeted sequencing of portions of TP53 and MYC demonstrated greater mutation accumulation in the A3B-eGFP exposed pools. Clones were generated and microarray analyses were used to identify those with the greatest number of SNP alterations for whole genome sequencing. A3B-eGFP exposed clones showed global increases in C-to-T transition mutations, enrichments for cytosine mutations within A3B-preferred trinucleotide motifs, and more copy number aberrations. Surprisingly, both control and A3B-eGFP clones also elicited strong mutator phenotypes characteristic of defective mismatch repair. Despite this additional mutational process, the 293-based system characterized here still yielded a genome-wide view of A3B-catalyzed mutagenesis in human cells and a system for additional studies on the compounded effects of simultaneous mutation mechanisms in cancer cells.

27163732|t|Prevalence and Diagnostic Performance of Isolated and Combined NEXUS Chest CT Decision Criteria.
27163732|a|OBJECTIVES: The use of chest computed tomography (CT) to evaluate emergency department (ED) patients with adult blunt trauma is rising. The NEXUS Chest CT decision instruments are highly sensitive identifiers of adult blunt trauma patients with thoracic injuries. However, many patients without injury exhibit one of more of the criteria so cannot be classified "low-risk." We sought to determine screening performance of both individual and combined NEXUS Chest CT criteria as predictors of thoracic injury to inform chest CT imaging decisions in "non-low-risk" patients. METHODS: This secondary analysis of data on patients in the derivation and validation cohorts of the prospective, observational NEXUS Chest CT study was performed September 2011-May 2014 in eleven Level 1 trauma centers. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained at all study sites. Adult blunt trauma patients receiving chest CT were included. The primary outcome was injury and major clinical injury prevalence and screening performance in patients with combinations of one, two or three of seven individual NEXUS Chest CT criteria. RESULTS: Across the eleven study sites, rates of chest CT performance ranged from 15.5% to 77.2% (median 43.6%). We found injuries in 1,493/5,169 patients (28.9%) who had chest CT; 269 patients (5.2%) had major clinical injury (e.g., pneumothorax requiring chest tube). With sensitivity of 73.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 68.1-78.6) and specificity of 83.9 (95% CI 83.6-84.2) for major clinical injury, abnormal CXR was the single most important screening criterion. When patients had only abnormal CXR, injury and major clinical injury prevalence were 60.7% (95% CI 52.2-68.6) and 12.9% (95% CI 8.3-19.4), respectively. Injury and major clinical injury prevalence when any other single criterion alone (other than abnormal CXR) was present were 16.8% (95% CI 15.2-18.6) and 1.1% (95% CI 0.1-1.8) respectively. Injury and major clinical injury prevalence among patients when two and three criteria (not abnormal CXR) were present were 25.5% (95% CI 23.1-28.0) and 3.2% (95% CI 2.3-4.4), and 34.9% (95% CI 31.0-39.0) and 2.7% (95% CI 1.6-4.5) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that clinicians check for the six clinical NEXUS Chest CT criteria and review the CXR (if obtained). If patients have one clinical criterion (other than abnormal CXR), they will have a very low risk of clinically major injury. We recommend that clinicians discuss the potential risks and benefit of chest CT in these cases. The risks of injury and major clinical injury rise incrementally with more criteria, rendering the risk/benefit ratio toward performing CT in most cases. If the patient has an abnormal CXR, the risks of major clinical injury and minor injury are considerably higher than with the other criteria-chest CT may be indicated in cases requiring greater anatomical detail and injury characterization.

27163986|t|Effect of Macitentan on the Development of New Ischemic Digital Ulcers in Patients With Systemic Sclerosis: DUAL-1 and DUAL-2 Randomized Clinical Trials.
27163986|a|Importance: Digital ulcers in patients with systemic sclerosis are associated with pain and poor quality of life. Endothelin-1 promotes vasculopathy in systemic sclerosis after macitentan, an endothelin-1 blocker. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of macitentan in reducing the number of new digital ulcers in patients with systemic sclerosis. Design, Setting, and Participants: Two international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (DUAL-1, DUAL-2) were conducted between January 2012 and February 2014. Participants were patients with systemic sclerosis and active digital ulcers at baseline. Target enrollment for each study was 285 patients. Interventions: Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive oral doses of 3 mg of macitentan, 10 mg of macitentan, or placebo once daily and stratified according to number of digital ulcers at baseline ( <=3 or >3). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome for each trial was the cumulative number of new digital ulcers from baseline to week 16. Treatment effect was expressed as the ratio between treatment groups. Results: In DUAL-1, among 289 randomized patients (mean age 51.2 years; 85.8% women), 226 completed the study. The adjusted mean number of new digital ulcers per patient over 16 weeks was 0.94 in the 3-mg macitentan group (n   =   95) and 1.08 in the 10-mg macitentan group (n   =   97) compared with 0.85 in the placebo group (n   =   97) (absolute difference, 0.09 [95% CI, -0.37 to 0.54] for 3 mg of macitentan vs placebo and 0.23 [-0.27 to 0.72] for 10 mg of macitentan vs placebo). Among 265 patients randomized in DUAL-2 (mean age 49.6 years; 81.9% women), 216 completed the study. In DUAL-2, the adjusted mean number of new digital ulcers was 1.44 in the 3-mg macitentan group (n   =   88) and 1.46 in the 10-mg macitentan group (n   =   88) compared with 1.21 in the placebo group (n   =   89) (absolute difference, 0.23 [95% CI, -0.35 to 0.82] for 3 mg of macitentan vs placebo and 0.25 [95% CI, -0.34 to 0.84] for 10 mg of macitentan vs placebo). Adverse events more frequently associated with macitentan than with placebo were headache, peripheral edema, skin ulcer, anemia, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, and nasopharyngitis. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with systemic sclerosis and active ischemic digital ulcers, treatment with macitentan did not reduce new digital ulcers over 16 weeks. These results do not support the use of macitentan for the treatment of digital ulcers in this patient population. Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifiers: NCT01474109, NCT01474122.

27097052|t|Design Thinking as a Tool for Interdisciplinary Education in Health Care.
27097052|a|PROBLEM: Grappling with complex structural health care issues requires medical professionals to have training in skills and knowledge that go beyond the basic and clinical sciences. It is also crucial for health care professionals to be able to work collaboratively. However, medical education has only limitedly institutionalized the teaching of these skills. APPROACH: In fall 2014, a one-semester crossover course called Hacking Healthcare was developed by the University of Amsterdam in cooperation with the Gerrit Rietveld Academie of Fine Arts and six health care institutions in the greater Amsterdam area. The course comprised one or two weekly three-hour evening sessions consisting of a lecture, workshop, and group work. It was structured using the three stages of the design thinking process-inspiration, ideation, and implementation. Twenty-seven medicine, psychology, other science disciplines, and art students participated, working in interdisciplinary groups on an assigned case study. OUTCOMES: The course yielded both unconventional and holistic key insights and a wide range of tangible outcomes, which were also considered to be relevant by the patient. Among university (i.e., nonart) students (n = 14), the average overall score of the course was 8.5 out of 10, with 10 being the highest rating. Aspects of the course that were mentioned as positive points were the activating teaching environment, academic development, and development of collaboration skills and creative capabilities. NEXT STEPS: This approach could be applied in other fields, such as medical education on a larger scale, clinical practice, and the design of scientific research.

27069801|t|Colony geometry and structural complexity of the endangered species Acropora cervicornis partly explains the structure of their associated fish assemblage.
27069801|a|In the past decade, significant efforts have been made to describe fish-habitat associations. However, most studies have oversimplified actual connections between fish assemblages and their habitats by using univariate correlations. The purpose of this study was to identify the features of habitat forming corals that facilitate and influences assemblages of associated species such as fishes. For this we developed three-dimensional models of colonies of Acropora cervicornis to estimate geometry (length and height), structural complexity (i.e., volume, density of branches, etc.) and biological features of the colonies (i.e., live coral tissue, algae). We then correlated these colony characteristics with the associated fish assemblage using multivariate analyses. We found that geometry and complexity were better predictors of the structure of fish community, compared to other variables such as percentage of live coral tissue or algae. Combined, the geometry of each colony explained 40% of the variability of the fish assemblage structure associated with this coral species; 61% of the abundance and 69% of fish richness, respectively. Our study shows that three-dimensional reconstructions of discrete colonies of Acropora cervicornis provides a useful description of the colonial structural complexity and may explain a great deal of the variance in the structure of the associated coral reef fish community. This demonstration of the strongly trait-dependent ecosystem role of this threatened species has important implications for restoration and conservation efforts.

27077497|t|Abusive Experiences and Young Women's Sexual Health Outcomes: Is Condom Negotiation Self-Efficacy a Mediator?
27077497|a|CONTEXT: Intimate partner violence and reproductive coercion are associated with unintended pregnancies and STDs. Greater condom negotiation self-efficacy among young women may mediate these associations. METHODS: A sample of 841 female adolescents (aged 16-19) and 1,387 young adult women (aged 20-24) recruited from 24 family planning clinics in western Pennsylvania in 2011-2012 reported on intimate partner violence, reproductive coercion, condom negotiation self-efficacy and sexual health outcomes at baseline and four- and 12-month follow-ups. Mixed models were used to test associations of intimate partner violence and reproductive coercion with unintended pregnancy and STD diagnosis. The Sobel test of mediation was used to measure indirect effects of condom negotiation self-efficacy. RESULTS: At baseline, 15% of adolescents and 11% of young adults reported recent intimate partner violence victimization; 7% and 6%, respectively, reported recent reproductive coercion. For both age-groups, intimate partner violence and reproductive coercion were associated with a reduced level of condom negotiation self-efficacy (coefficients, -0.27 to -0.13) and increased odds of STD diagnosis (odds ratios, 1.03-1.1). However, only reproductive coercion was associated with unintended pregnancy (odds ratios, 1.1 for each group). The only association that condom negotiation self-efficacy mediated was between reproductive coercion and unintended pregnancy among young adults (17% of total effect). CONCLUSIONS: Targeting condom negotiation self-efficacy alone in abusive relationships would likely not translate into improved sexual health outcomes in this population. Other strategies are needed to prevent unintended pregnancy and STDs.

27083907|t|Importance of organic amendment characteristics on bioremediation of PAH-contaminated soil.
27083907|a|UNASSIGNED: This study investigates the importance of the organic matter characteristics of several organic amendments (i.e., buffalo manure, food and kitchen waste, fruit and vegetables waste, and activated sewage sludge) and their influence in the bioremediation of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)-contaminated soil. The removal of low molecular weights (LMW) and high molecular weights (HMW) PAHs was monitored in four bioremediation reactors and used as an indicator of the role of organic amendments in contaminant removal. The total initial concentration of LMW PAHs was 234  mg  kg(-1) soil (dry weight), while the amount for HMW PAHs was 422  mg  kg(-1) soil (dry weight). Monitoring of operational parameters and chemical analysis was performed during 20  weeks. The concentrations of LMW PAH residues in soil were significantly lower in reactors that displayed a mesophilic phase, i.e., 11 and 15  %, compared to reactors that displayed a thermophilic phase, i.e., 29 and 31  %. Residual HMW PAHs were up to five times higher compared to residual LMW PAHs, depending on the reactor. This demonstrated that the amount of added organic matter and macronutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, the biochemical organic compound classes (mostly soluble fraction and proteins), and the operational temperature are important factors affecting the overall efficiency of bioremediation. On that basis, this study shows that characterization of biochemical families could contribute to a better understanding of the effects of organic amendments and clarify their different efficiency during a bioremediation process of PAH-contaminated soil.

27112161|a|UNASSIGNED: The aims of this study are to establish an embryonic stem (ES) cell model of polycystic ovary syndrome and to characterize this ES cell line. ES cells were isolated and cultured from 322 wasted fertilized embryos from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients in vitro. They were also characterized by development and differential markers. ES cells from PCOS subject present normal development profile with ES-specific markers such as OCT-4 and SSEA-4. These ES cells can also differentiate into three germ layer derivatives and form teratomas in vivo. ES cells from PCOS patients pose development and differentiation potentials as you would expect of cells from non-PCOS patients; therefore, they can be used as a cellular model to study the pathology of PCOS.

27032075|t|Renal hemodynamics and renin-angiotensin system activity in humans with multifocal renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia.
27032075|a|BACKGROUND: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is the second most common cause of renovascular hypertension. Nonetheless, knowledge on the renal microvasculature and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activity in kidneys with FMD is scarce. Given the fairly good results of revascularization, we hypothesized that the renal microvasculature and RAS are relatively spared in kidneys with FMD. METHOD: In 58 hypertensive patients with multifocal renal artery FMD (off medication) and 116 matched controls with essential hypertension, we measured renal blood flow (Xenon washout method) per kidney and drew blood samples from the aorta and both renal veins to determine renin secretion and glomerular filtration rate per kidney. RESULTS: We found that renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate in FMD were comparable to those in controls. Although systemic renin levels were somewhat higher in FMD, renal renin secretion was not elevated. Moreover, in patients with unilateral FMD, no differences between the affected and unaffected kidney were observed with regard to renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, or renin secretion. In men, renin levels and renin secretion were higher as compared with women. The renal blood flow response to RAS modulation (by intrarenal infusion of angiotensin II, angiotensin-(1-7), an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, or a nitric oxide synthase blocker) was also comparable between FMD and controls. CONCLUSION: Renal blood flow, glomerular filtration, and the response to vasoactive substances in kidneys with multifocal FMD are comparable to patients with essential hypertension, suggesting that microvascular function is relatively spared. Renin secretion was not increased and the response to RAS modulation was not affected in kidneys with FMD.

27000640|t|Recent Development of Advanced Materials with Special Wettability for Selective Oil/Water Separation.
27000640|a|UNASSIGNED: The increasing number of oil spill accidents have a catastrophic impact on our aquatic environment. Recently, special wettable materials used for the oil/water separation have received significant research attention. Due to their opposing affinities towards water and oil, i.e., hydrophobic and oleophilic, or hydrophilic and oleophobic, such materials can be used to remove only one phase from the oil/water mixture, and simultaneously repel the other phase, thus achieving selective oil/water separation. Moreover, the synergistic effect between the surface chemistry and surface architecture can further promote the superwetting behavior, resulting in the improved separation efficiency. Here, recently developed materials with special wettability for selective oil/water separation are summarized and discussed. These materials can be categorized based on their oil/water separating mechanisms, i.e., filtration and absorption. In each section, representative studies will be highlighted, with emphasis on the materials wetting properties and innovative aspects. Finally, challenges and future research directions in this emerging and promising research field will be briefly described.

27080243|t|Refractory and super-refractory status epilepticus in adults: a 9-year cohort study.
27080243|a|OBJECTIVE: While status epilepticus (SE) persisting after two antiseizure agents is called refractory (RSE), super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) defines SE continuing after general anaesthesia. Its prevalence and related clinical profiles have received limited attention, and most studies were restricted to intensive care facilities. We therefore aimed at describing RSE and SRSE frequencies and identifying associated clinical variables. METHODS: Between 2006 and 2015, consecutive adult SE episodes were prospectively recorded in a registry. Occurrence of RSE and SRSE and their relationship to clinical variables of interest, including outcome, were analysed. RESULTS: Of 804 SE episodes, 268 (33.3%) were RSE and 33 (4%) SRSE. Coma induction for SE treatment occurred in 79 (9.8%) episodes. Severe consciousness impairment (OR 1.67; 95% CI 1.24-2.46; P = 0.001), increasing age (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.01-1.02), and lack of remote symptomatic SE aetiology (OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.32-0.72) were independently associated with RSE, while severe consciousness impairment (OR 4.26; 95% CI 1.44-12.60) and younger age (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.95-0.99) correlated with SRSE; however, most SRSE episodes were not predicted by these variables. Mortality was 15.5% overall, higher in RSE (24.5%) and SRSE (37.9%) than in non-refractory SE (9.8%) (P < 0.001). SIGNIFICANCE: Super-refractory status epilepticus appears clearly less prevalent in this cohort than previously reported, probably as it is not restricted to intensive care unit. SRSE emerges in younger patients with marked consciousness impairment, pointing to the underlying severe clinical background, but these variables do not predict most SRSE developments. There is currently a knowledge gap for prediction of SRSE occurrence that needs to be filled.

27059958|t|Structural Determinants of Binding the Seven-transmembrane Domain of the Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Receptor.
27059958|a|UNASSIGNED: The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) belongs to the secretin-like (class B) family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Members of the class B family are distinguished by their large extracellular domain (ECD), which works cooperatively with the canonical seven-transmembrane (7TM) helical domain to signal in response to binding of various peptide hormones. We have combined structure-based site-specific mutational studies with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a full-length model of GLP-1R bound to multiple peptide ligand variants. Despite the high sequence similarity between GLP-1R and its closest structural homologue, the glucagon receptor (GCGR), nearly half of the 62 stably expressed mutants affected GLP-1R in a different manner than the corresponding mutants in GCGR. The MD simulations of wild-type and mutant GLP-1R-ligand complexes provided molecular insights into GLP-1R specific recognition mechanisms for the N-terminus of GLP-1 by residues in the 7TM pocket, and explained how glucagon mimicking GLP-1 mutants restored binding affinity for (GCGR mimicking) GLP-1R mutants. Structural analysis of the simulations suggested that peptide ligand binding-mode variations in the 7TM binding pocket are facilitated by movement of the ECD relative to the 7TM bundle. These differences in binding modes may account for the pharmacological differences between GLP-1 peptide variants.

27164908|t|Application of a new method, orthogonal projection to latent structure (OPLS) combined with principal component analysis (PCA), to screening of prostaglandin E2 production inhibitory flavonoids in Scutellaria Root.
27164908|a|UNASSIGNED: A new method consisting of orthogonal projection to latent structure (OPLS) and modified principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to a screening of bioactive compounds from natural products. In this report, extracts of 52 Scutellaria Root (the root of  Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi) samples were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and their inhibitory activities towards prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in a murine macrophage-like cell line J774.1 were examined. Wogonin and oroxylin A were predicted to be strong inhibitors of PGE2 production by OPLS analysis of the data. However, 6-methoxywogonin, which has been reported to have inhibitory activity, was omitted. Modified PCA was then applied to these data as a filter to exclude compounds less relevant to the activity, and OPLS analysis was applied to the modified data. As a result, this method predicted wogonin, oroxylin A and 6-methoxywogonin to be strong inhibitors of PGE2 production without any prior knowledge. The predictions by the OPLS combined with PCA method of PGE2 production inhibitory activities of 52 samples showed good agreement with the actual data. This method is simple and effective and can be used in screening of bioactive natural compounds without any prior knowledge.

27168003|t|PARP inhibition and gynecologic malignancies: A review of current literature and on-going trials.
27168003|a|UNASSIGNED: The poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family of enzymes is important in several DNA repair pathways. Drugs that inhibit these enzymes have been investigated in many types of cancer, but their application in the treatment of gynecologic malignancies has rapidly evolved - as manifested by the 2014 FDA approval for olaparib in the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer associated with a germline BRCA mutation (gBRCA). In efforts to broaden their efficacy, current clinical trials have demonstrated benefit of olaparib, and other PARP inhibitors (PARPi), as single agents and in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy and biologic agents, in wide ranging populations. Although the majority of data for PARPi in gynecologic malignancies has been specifically regarding ovarian cancer, their role in the treatment of uterine and cervical cancer is currently being investigated. This review will serve as a synopsis of seminal trials to date, summarize the breadth of clinical application in on-going studies, query how these results may change future practice, and reflect on questions yet to be answered.

27035219|t|p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibition modulates nucleus pulposus cell apoptosis in spontaneous resorption of herniated intervertebral discs: An experimental study in rats.
27035219|a|UNASSIGNED: The present study was performed to investigate the role of p38 mitogen  -activated protein kinase (MAPK) in the resorption of herniated intervertebral discs in 30  rats. In the non  -contained and p38 MAPK inhibition (p38i) groups, two coccygeal intervertebral discs (IVDs) were removed and wounded prior to relocation into the subcutaneous space of the skin of the back. In the contained group, the cartilage endplates maintained their integrity. Furthermore, SB203580 was injected intraperitoneally into the p38i group, whereas saline was injected into the other two groups. In the non  -contained group, the weight of the relocated IVDs decreased to a greater extent over time when compared with the contained and p38i groups. Phosphorylated p38, tumor necrosis factor  -a, and interleukin  -1b were observed to exhibit higher expression levels in the non  -contained group compared with the contained and p38i groups, at weeks  1 and  4 post  -surgery. The expression level of caspase  -3 and the densities of apoptotic disc cells were significantly higher in the non  -contained group compared with the contained and p38i groups at 4  weeks post  -surgery. In conclusion, p38 MAPK induces apoptosis in IVDs, while also accelerating the resorption of the relocated IVDs. Thus, p38 MAPK may be important in spontaneous resorption of IVDs.

27034854|t|Gingival Enlargement Induced by Felodipine Resolves with a Conventional Periodontal Treatment and Drug Modification.
27034854|a|We present a case of a 47-year-old male who suffered from GE around his lower anterior teeth as soon as he started treatment with Felodipine 400   mg. We show that oral hygiene measures, antibiotics, and conventional periodontal treatment (scaling and root planing SRP) were all not sufficient to resolve the drug induced GE, which will persist and/or recur provided that systemic effect of the offending medication is still present. The condition immediately resolved after switching to a different medication. The mechanism of GE is complex and not fully understood yet. It is mainly due to overexpression of a number of growth factors due to high concentrations of calcium ions (Ca(2+)). This affects fibroblasts proliferation and DNA synthesis and leads to a heavy chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate. Our case was managed according to the suggested protocols in previous case studies. The unique features in our case were the immediate onset of the adverse effect after starting the medication and the absence of any underlying medical condition apart from high blood pressure. Improving the oral hygiene together with SRP and cessation of the medication resolves drug induced GE.

27167532|t|A new extranodal scoring system based on the prognostically relevant extranodal sites in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified treated with chemoimmunotherapy.
27167532|a|UNASSIGNED: Extranodal involvement is a well-known prognostic factor in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). Nevertheless, the prognostic impact of the extranodal scoring system included in the conventional international prognostic index (IPI) has been questioned in an era where rituximab treatment has become widespread. We investigated the prognostic impacts of individual sites of extranodal involvement in 761 patients with DLBCL who received rituximab-based chemoimmunotherapy. Subsequently, we established a new extranodal scoring system based on extranodal sites, showing significant prognostic correlation, and compared this system with conventional scoring systems, such as the IPI and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network-IPI (NCCN-IPI). An internal validation procedure, using bootstrapped samples, was also performed for both univariate and multivariate models. Using multivariate analysis with a backward variable selection, we found nine extranodal sites (the liver, lung, spleen, central nervous system, bone marrow, kidney, skin, adrenal glands, and peritoneum) that remained significant for use in the final model. Our newly established extranodal scoring system, based on these sites, was better correlated with patient survival than standard scoring systems, such as the IPI and the NCCN-IPI. Internal validation by bootstrapping demonstrated an improvement in model performance of our modified extranodal scoring system. Our new extranodal scoring system, based on the prognostically relevant sites, may improve the performance of conventional prognostic models of DLBCL in the rituximab era and warrants further external validation using large study populations.

27166858|t|Combination therapies for neurobehavioral and cognitive recovery after experimental traumatic brain injury: Is more better?
27166858|a|UNASSIGNED: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant health care crisis that affects two million individuals in the United Sates alone and over ten million worldwide each year. While numerous monotherapies have been evaluated and shown to be beneficial at the bench, similar results have not translated to the clinic. One reason for the lack of successful translation may be due to the fact that TBI is a heterogeneous disease that affects multiple mechanisms, thus requiring a therapeutic approach that can act on complementary, rather than single, targets. Hence, the use of combination therapies (i.e., polytherapy) has emerged as a viable approach. Stringent criteria, such as verification of each individual treatment plus the combination, a focus on behavioral outcome, and post-injury vs. pre-injury treatments, were employed to determine which studies were appropriate for review. The selection process resulted in 37 papers that fit the specifications. The review, which is the first to comprehensively assess the effects of combination therapies on behavioral outcomes after TBI, encompasses five broad categories (inflammation, oxidative stress, neurotransmitter dysregulation, neurotrophins, and stem cells, with and without rehabilitative therapies). Overall, the findings suggest that combination therapies can be more beneficial than monotherapies as indicated by 46% of the studies exhibiting an additive or synergistic positive effect versus on 19% reporting a negative interaction. These encouraging findings serve as an impetus for continued combination studies after TBI and ultimately for the development of successful clinically relevant therapies.

27114046|a|UNASSIGNED: A copper-catalyzed amino lactonization of unsaturated carboxylic acids has been achieved as well as the analogous intermolecular three-component amino oxygenation of olefins. The transformation features mild conditions and a remarkably broad substrate scope, offering a novel and efficient approach to construct a wide range of amino lactones as well as 1,2-amino alcohol derivatives. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds via a distinctive O-benzoylhydroxylamine-promoted electrophilic amination of alkenes.

27066173|t|Genome-wide epigenetic analysis of MEF2A and MEF2C transcription factors in mouse cortical neurons.
27066173|a|The transcription factors of the myocyte enhancer factor 2 family (MEF2 A-D) are highly expressed in the brain and play a key role in neuronal survival/apoptosis, differentiation and synaptic plasticity. However, the precise genome-wide mapping of different members of the family has not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we report the comparative analysis of MEF2A and MEF2C genome-wide mapping in mouse cortical neurons by ChIP-seq, a powerful approach to elucidate the genomic functions of transcription factors and to identify their transcriptional targets. Our analysis reveals that MEF2A and MEF2C each orchestrate similar epigenomic programs mainly through the binding of enhancer regulatory elements in proximity of target genes involved in neuronal plasticity and calcium signaling. We highlight the differences in the enhancer networks and molecular pathways regulated by MEF2A and MEF2C, which might be determined by the combinatorial action of different transcription factors.

27066379|a|Nowadays, information and communication technology is major backbone of Indian education system. To support E-learning in Universities, information and communication technology (ICT) plays a momentous job. Several experts discussed about ICT awareness among students, teachers, and research scholars to take it into their learning and teaching methodology. Many of Universities either government or private are supporting the utilization of various ICT tools in teaching and learning practice. There is wide need to determine educator's behaviour towards ICT adoption to promote and enhance their learning skills. Students and faculty must confess that ICT awareness is key rod to access the technological services. This paper focuses on ICT awareness among students and faculty residing in Indian Universities. The concerned paper is describing the attitude of students and faculty towards ICT awareness in relation to their gender using statistical tools. More than nine hundred samples have been gathered from six Indian universities. The findings of this paper will help to Indian Universities administration to get aware about current scenario of ICT involvement in education system therein.

27052432|t|Behavioral and neural correlates of self-referential processing deficits in bipolar disorder.
27052432|a|Self-referential processing is a core component of social cognition. However, few studies have focused on whether self-referential processing deficits present in bipolar disorder. The current study combined a high-time-resolution event-related potential (ERP) technique with the self-referential memory (SRM) task to evaluate self-referential processing in 23 bipolar patients and 27 healthy controls. All subjects showed a reliable SRM effect, but the bipolar group had poorer recognition scores for the self- and other-referential conditions. The bipolar group presented with smaller voltages in both the self- and other-referential conditions for the N1 (150-220   ms) and the P2 components (130-320   ms) but larger voltages in the positive slow wave (600-1600   ms) component. Larger P3 amplitudes were elicited in the self-referential condition compared with the other-referential condition in controls but not in bipolar patients. Additionally, non-psychotic bipolar patients had a comparative normal SRM effect which was abolished in psychotic bipolar patients; non-psychotic bipolar patients had larger amplitudes of the positive slow wave than the normal controls, whereas it was not differed between psychotic bipolar patients and the healthy subjects. The present study suggests that self- and other-referential processing is impaired in bipolar patients and the deficits may be more pronounced in psychotic bipolar patients.

First, a retrospective study examining perioperative b-blocker use and cancer recurrence and metastases was conducted on 1,029  patients who underwent breast cancer surgery at the City of Hope Cancer Center between  2000 and  2010. We followed the clinical study and examined proliferation, migration, and invasion in  vitro of primary and brain-metastatic breast cancer cells in response to b2-activation and inhibition. We also investigated in  vivo the metastatic potential of propranolol-treated metastatic cells. For stage  II breast cancer patients, perioperative b-blockade was associated with decreased cancer recurrence using Cox regression analysis (hazard's ratio  =0.51; 95%  CI: 0.23-0.97; p=0.041). Triple-negative (TN) brain-metastatic cells were found to have increased b2-adrenergic receptor mRNA and protein expression relative to TN primary cells. In response to b2-adrenergic receptor activation, TN brain-metastatic cells also exhibited increased cell proliferation and migration relative to the control. These effects were abrogated by propranolol. Propranolol decreased b2-adrenergic receptor-activated invasion. In  vivo, propranolol treatment of TN brain-metastatic cells decreased establishment of brain metastases. Our results suggest that stress and corresponding b2-activation may promote the establishment of brain metastases of TN breast cancer cells. In addition, our data suggest a benefit to perioperative b-blockade during surgery-induced stress with respect to breast cancer recurrence and metastases.

27027935|t|Visual Attention to Dynamic Scenes of Ambiguous Provocation and Children's Aggressive Behavior.
27027935|a|UNASSIGNED: Research on biases in attention related to children's aggression has yielded mixed results. Some research suggests that inattention to social cues and reliance on maladaptive social schemas underlie aggression. Other research suggests that maladaptive social schemas lead aggressive individuals to attend to nonhostile cues. The primary objective of this study was to test the proposition that aggression is related to delayed attention to cues followed by selective attention to nonhostile cues after the provocation has occurred. A second objective was to test whether these biases are associated with aggression only when children hold negative social schemas. The eye fixations of 70 children (34 boys, 36 girls; Mage  =  11.71  years) were monitored with an eye tracker as they watched video clips of child actors portraying scenes of ambiguous provocation. Aggression was measured using peer-, teacher-, and parent-reports, and children completed a measure of antisocial and prosocial peer beliefs. Aggressive behavior was associated with greater time until fixation on the provocateur among youth who held antisocial peer beliefs. Aggression was also associated with greater time until fixation on an actor displaying empathy for the victim among children reporting low levels of prosocial peer beliefs. After the provocation, aggression was associated with suppressed attention to an amused peer among children who held negative peer beliefs. Increasing attention to cues in a scene of ambiguous provocation, in conjunction with fostering more positive beliefs about peers, may be effective in reducing hostile responding among aggressive youth.

27025502|t|Do Arabic numerals activate magnitude automatically? Evidence from the psychological refractory period paradigm.
27025502|a|UNASSIGNED: A single experiment (N = 30) tested the claim that Arabic numerals automatically activate their magnitude representations by assessing whether central attention is required in order to activate magnitude within the psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm. Subjects performed a color discrimination task as Task 1 and a parity judgment task as Task 2. Task overlap was controlled by varying stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA). A spatial-numerical association of response codes (SNARC) effect arose in Task 2 and yielded under-additive effects with decreasing SOA. This result suggests that magnitude is activated prior to central attention, and is therefore consistent with the claim that numerals activate magnitude automatically.

27026059|t|Clinical effects of an avocado-soybean unsaponifiable extract on arthralgia and osteoarthritis of the temporomandibular joint: preliminary study.
27026059|a|UNASSIGNED: The aim of the present preliminary study was to investigate the effectiveness of an avocado-soybean unsaponifiable extract (ASU) in patients with arthralgia and osteoarthritis of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was carried out. Fourteen women diagnosed with arthralgia and osteoarthritis of the TMJ using the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders were included in the statistical analysis. The women were allocated randomly to two groups: ASU group and placebo group. Pain was measured using a visual analogue scale and pressure algometer. Mandibular function was evaluated through measurement of mandibular movements. Quality of life was measured using the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14). The medication (ASU capsules or placebo capsules) was used for 4 months and the total follow-up was 6 months. Those taking the ASU extract had a decrease in pain symptoms and an improvement in quality of life. Moreover, a significant reduction in the use of rescue medication was found in the ASU group compared to the placebo group. This preliminary study provides strong evidence of the effectiveness of an avocado-soybean unsaponifiable extract in patients with degenerative joint diseases and arthralgia in the TMJ. Further studies with larger samples should be performed.

27008176|t|Power, Politics, and Health: A New Public Health Practice Targeting the Root Causes of Health Equity.
27008176|a|UNASSIGNED: Purpose Understanding the WHY, WHAT, and HOW of place-based work in maternal and child health (MCH) is critical to examining the components of the environment that shape health opportunity through the relationship between life expectancy and neighborhood residence. Description On September 18, 2014, during the CityMatCH Leadership and MCH Epidemiology Conference, Dr. Anthony Iton provided the Keynote Address focused on the root causes of health inequities. Assessment The address focused on issues of equity in California and initiatives designed to mitigate and prevent disparities, including the Bay Area Regional Health Equities Initiative framework. Dr. Iton presented information on how the framework translated into investment strategies and a policy and systems change approach to place-based work. Conclusion The field of MCH, because of its focus on supporting health during critical periods of development, is poised to play a significant role in reducing health inequities. Recognizing that human health suffers when low income communities are passive, disenfranchised and disorganized, in order to change this status quo, understanding that human capital is the greatest asset is the urgent challenge to the field of MCH.

27004589|t|The Effect of Pose Variability and Repeated Reliability of Segmental Centres of Mass Acquisition when Using 3D Photonic Scanning.
27004589|a|UNASSIGNED: Three-dimensional (3D) photonic scanning is an emerging technique to acquire accurate body segment parameter (BSP) data. This study established the repeated reliability of segmental centres of mass when using 3D photonic scanning (3DPS). Seventeen male participants were scanned twice by a 3D whole-body laser scanner. The same operators conducted the reconstruction and segmentation processes to obtain segmental meshes for calculating the segmental centres of mass. The segmental centres of mass obtained from repeated 3DPS were compared by relative technical error of measurement (TEM). Hypothesis tests were conducted to determine the size of change required for each segment to be determined a true variation. The relative TEMs for all segments were less than 5%. The relative changes in centres of mass at   1.5% for most segments can be detected (p<0.05). The arm segments which are difficult to keep in the same scanning pose generated more error than other segments. Practitioner Summary Three-dimensional photonic scanning is an emerging technique to acquire body segment parameter data. This study established the repeated reliability of segmental centres of mass when using 3D photonic scanning and emphasised that the error for arm segments need to be considered while using this technique to acquire centres of mass.

27133205|t|Evaluation of in situ valine production by Bacillus subtilis in young pigs.
27133205|a|UNASSIGNED: Mutants of Bacillus subtilis can be developed to overproduce Val in vitro. It was hypothesized that addition of Bacillus subtilis mutants to pig diets can be a strategy to supply the animal with Val. The objective was to investigate the effect of Bacillus subtilis mutants on growth performance and blood amino acid (AA) concentrations when fed to piglets. Experiment 1 included 18 pigs (15.0  1.1 kg) fed one of three diets containing either 0.63 or 0.69 standardized ileal digestible (SID) Val : Lys, or 0.63 SID Val : Lys supplemented with a Bacillus subtilis mutant (mutant 1). Blood samples were obtained 0.5 h before feeding and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 h after feeding and analyzed for AAs. In Experiment 2, 80 piglets (9.1  1.1 kg) were fed one of four diets containing 0.63 or 0.67 SID Val : Lys, or 0.63 SID Val : Lys supplemented with another Bacillus subtilis mutant (mutant 2) or its parent wild type. Average daily feed intake, daily weight gain and feed conversion ratio were measured on days 7, 14 and 21. On day 17, blood samples were taken and analyzed for AAs. On days 24 to 26, six pigs from each dietary treatment were fitted with a permanent jugular vein catheter, and blood samples were taken for AA analysis 0.5 h before feeding and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 h after feeding. In experiment 1, Bacillus subtilis mutant 1 tended (P<0.10) to increase the plasma levels of Val at 2 and 3 h post-feeding, but this was not confirmed in Experiment 2. In Experiment 2, Bacillus subtilis mutant 2 and the wild type did not result in a growth performance different from the negative and positive controls. In conclusion, results obtained with the mutant strains of Bacillus subtilis were not better than results obtained with the wild-type strain, and for both strains, the results were not different than the negative control.

27135638|t|Effects of low-oxygen conditions on embryo growth in the painted turtle, Chrysemys picta.
27135638|a|UNASSIGNED: Low-oxygen conditions (hypoxia; < 21% O2 ) are considered unfavorable for growth; yet, embryos of many vertebrate taxa develop successfully in hypoxic subterranean environments. Though enhanced tolerance to hypoxia has been demonstrated in adult reptiles, such as in the painted turtle (Chrysemys picta), its effects on sensitive embryo life stages warrant attention. We tested the hypothesis that short-term hypoxia negatively affects growth during day 40 of development in C. picta, when O2 demands are highest in embryos. A brief, but severe, hypoxic event (5% O2 for 0.5 h) moderately affected embryo growth, causing a 13% reduction in mass (relative to a normoxic control). The same condition had no effect during day 27; instead a nearly anoxic event (1% O2 for 72 h) caused a 5% mass reduction. All embryos survived the egg incubation period. Our study supports the assumption that reptilian embryos are resilient to intermittently low O2 in subterranean nests. Further work is needed to ascertain responses to suboptimal O2 levels while undergoing dynamic changes in developmental physiology. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

27087039|t|Spatial analysis of incidence of cutaneous melanoma in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region in the period 1995-2005.
27087039|a|Incidence distribution of cutaneous melanoma depends on phenotypic characteristics of population and geographic location. In Italy, in the period 1999-2003 Friuli Venezia Giulia (FVG) region had the second highest incidence rates for males and the third for females. We analysed melanoma and lip cancer incidence data of the FVG cancer registry for the period 1995-2005. We used Bayesian hierarchical spatial models to describe the spatial pattern by gender. We decomposed the geographical distribution of the risk in two parts: a component linked to chronic exposure and a component related to intermittent exposure. In order to model the chronic component we considered the geographical distribution of incidence cases of lip cancer, for which chronic occupational solar radiation exposure is a documented risk factor. We also analysed the distribution by site and we calculated standardised rates for body surface area. This study documents a significant gradient in the incidence of cutaneous melanoma in FVG. Highstandardisedincidence rates are present in the area of Trieste and in the coastal area. The descriptive analysis by age group and by site, showed risks associated with intermittent exposures in both genders. For the coastal area the risk is especially high for sites traditionally linked to high cumulative exposures (face and neck), especially among men. The results suggest diagnostic preventive interventions in the populations living in the area of Trieste, given the high rates observed in the young age groups.

27146696|t|Representations of numerical and non-numerical magnitude both contribute to mathematical competence in children.
27146696|a|UNASSIGNED: A growing body of evidence suggests that non-symbolic representations of number, which humans share with nonhuman animals, are functionally related to uniquely human mathematical thought. Other research suggesting that numerical and non-numerical magnitudes not only share analog format but also form part of a general magnitude system raises questions about whether the non-symbolic basis of mathematical thinking is unique to numerical magnitude. Here we examined this issue in 5- and 6-year-old children using comparison tasks of non-symbolic number arrays and cumulative area as well as standardized tests of math competence. One set of findings revealed that scores on both magnitude comparison tasks were modulated by ratio, consistent with shared analog format. Moreover, scores on these tasks were moderately correlated, suggesting overlap in the precision of numerical and non-numerical magnitudes, as expected under a general magnitude system. Another set of findings revealed that the precision of both types of magnitude contributed shared and unique variance to the same math measures (e.g. calculation and geometry), after accounting for age and verbal competence. These findings argue against an exclusive role for non-symbolic number in supporting early mathematical understanding. Moreover, they suggest that mathematical understanding may be rooted in a general system of magnitude representation that is not specific to numerical magnitude but that also encompasses non-numerical magnitude.

27096365|t|Programmable editing of a target base in genomic DNA without double-stranded DNA cleavage.
27096365|a|UNASSIGNED: Current genome-editing technologies introduce double-stranded (ds) DNA breaks at a target locus as the first step to gene correction. Although most genetic diseases arise from point mutations, current approaches to point mutation correction are inefficient and typically induce an abundance of random insertions and deletions (indels) at the target locus resulting from the cellular response to dsDNA breaks. Here we report the development of 'base editing', a new approach to genome editing that enables the direct, irreversible conversion of one target DNA base into another in a programmable manner, without requiring dsDNA backbone cleavage or a donor template. We engineered fusions of CRISPR/Cas9 and a cytidine deaminase enzyme that retain the ability to be programmed with a guide RNA, do not induce dsDNA breaks, and mediate the direct conversion of cytidine to uridine, thereby effecting a C > T (or G > A) substitution. The resulting 'base editors' convert cytidines within a window of approximately five nucleotides, and can efficiently correct a variety of point mutations relevant to human disease. In four transformed human and murine cell lines, second- and third-generation base editors that fuse uracil glycosylase inhibitor, and that use a Cas9 nickase targeting the non-edited strand, manipulate the cellular DNA repair response to favour desired base-editing outcomes, resulting in permanent correction of ~15-75% of total cellular DNA with minimal (typically  <=1%) indel formation. Base editing expands the scope and efficiency of genome editing of point mutations.

27146390|t|Management of venous thromboembolism in cancer patients: the economic burden of hospitalizations.
27146390|a|PURPOSE: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is one of the most frequent events associated with cancer, requiring hospitalization and generating additional healthcare costs. To date, no studies analyzing the additional costs resulting from VTE associated with cancer in France have been published. The objective of this study was to provide an estimation of the additional cost induced by VTE with cancer by analyzing hospital stays reported in the 2013 PMSI French Hospital Database ("Programme de M  dicalisation des Syst  mes d'Information", a national hospital administrative database) for four cancer types (breast, lung, hepatocellular carcinoma, and colon). METHODS: The analysis is divided into three parts: a descriptive evaluation of hospitalizations for VTE with cancer, an analysis by severity level of diagnosis-related groups (DRG), and an estimation of the hospital costs based on the National Reference Costs (ENC). The French public ATIH ("Agence Technique de l'Information sur l'Hospitalisation", a national Agency for Data on Hospital Care) database was used. The critical approach of this study is based on analysis of the distribution of stays according to levels of severity of DRG. RESULTS: A total of 14,251 hospitalizations were analyzed combining VTE and cancer. Hospitalizations of the two highest levels of severity (levels 3 and 4) for VTE with cancer represented 81.7  % of all hospitalizations in this population. Increased costs were seen for all four cancer types evaluated, with cost coefficients ranging from 1.34 to 2.01. For example, the average cost of lung cancer in cancer patients with VTE in the PMSI database was 7296     versus 4647     in the ATIH database. Cost coefficients were calculated, ranging from 1.34 in colon cancer, 1.50 for breast cancer, 1.57 in lung cancer, and 2.01 for hepatocellular carcinoma. CONCLUSION: As discussed in the article, the current costs are high. Better physician adherence to clinical practice guidelines could potentially reduce these costs by lowering the number of recurrent VTE in patients with cancer.

27128169|t|Photooxidation of the antimicrobial, nonribosomal peptide bacitracin A by singlet oxygen under environmentally relevant conditions.
27128169|a|UNASSIGNED: Bacitracin is a mixture of nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) that is extensively used as an antibiotic in both human and veterinary medicine. Despite its widespread use over the past six decades, very few studies have addressed the environmental fate of bacitracin and zinc-bacitracin complexes. In this study, the photochemical transformation of bacitracin components (i.e., cyclic dodecapeptides) in the aquatic environment was investigated. A high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)-based approach enabled monitoring of the photochemical degradation kinetics of individual bacitracin components, investigation of the relative contribution of reactive oxygen species (e.g., singlet oxygen, (1)O2) in dissolved organic matter-sensitized photoreactions, and identification of oxidative modifications in bacitracin photoproducts. The results of this study support the hypothesis that indirect photochemical oxidation of the histidine (His) residue by (1)O2 is a major degradation pathway for bacitracin A, the most potent congener of the mixture. Furthermore, the photooxidation rate of bacitracin A with (1)O2 decreased upon bacitracin A coordination with Zn(2+), demonstrating that the photochemistry of metal-bound His is different from metal-free His. Overall, these results provide insight into the fate of bacitracin components in the aquatic environment and highlight the potential of utilizing this HRMS-based methodology to study transformations of other environmentally relevant NRPs.

27091426|t|Epstein-Barr virus latency type and spontaneous reactivation predict lytic induction levels.
27091426|a|UNASSIGNED: The human Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) evades the immune system by entering a transcriptionally latent phase in B cells. EBV in tumor cells expresses distinct patterns of genes referred to as latency types. Viruses in tumor cells also display varying levels of lytic transcription resulting from spontaneous reactivation out of latency. We measured this dynamic range of lytic transcription with RNA deep sequencing and observed no correlation with EBV latency types among genetically different viruses, but type I cell lines reveal more spontaneous reactivation than isogenic type III cultures. We further determined that latency type and spontaneous reactivation levels predict the relative amount of induced reactivation generated by cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs. Our work has potential implications for personalizing medicine against EBV-transformed malignancies. Identifying latency type or measuring spontaneous reactivation may provide predictive power in treatment contexts where viral production should be either avoided or coerced.

27127339|t|Safety and early onset of immunity with a novel European porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus vaccine in young piglets.
27127339|a|Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) can be difficult to manage in commercial settings. A novel type I PRRSV vaccinal strain (94881) was evaluated for safety and efficacy/onset of immunity (OOI) in piglets. In 2 experiments, groups of piglets were vaccinated intramuscularly (IM) at approximately 14 d of age with a maximum-range commercial dose, an overdose, or a placebo in experiment 1 and either a minimum-range commercial dose or a placebo in experiment 2. The piglets in experiment 1 were evaluated for local and systemic reactions from days -2 through 14 after vaccination. The piglets in experiment 2 were challenged with a virulent heterologous type I PRRSV isolate 14 d after vaccination and observed once daily for general health from days -1 through 12 after vaccination and once daily for clinical signs associated with challenge from days 13 through 24 after vaccination. The average daily weight gain (ADWG) and the results of serologic and viremia testing were evaluated in experiments 1 and 2. Lung lesion scores and results of testing for PRRSV in lung tissue were evaluated in experiment 2. In experiment 1 the vaccine was shown to be safe, as there were no relevant differences between the vaccinated piglets and the piglets given a placebo. In experiment 2 the vaccine's efficacy, with an OOI of 14 d after vaccination, was established, as the vaccinated and challenged piglets exhibited significantly lower lung lesion scores, viremia, viral load in lung tissue, and total clinical sign scores, along with a significantly greater ADWG, compared with the placebo-vaccinated and challenged piglets.

Because of the rarity, it is not usually considered as a differential diagnosis in any age group. Clinical features and Imaging is not characteristic, and most of them are thought to be some different tumor. Here, we discuss two cases harboring a primary fourth ventricular meningioma Grade II, which was surgically excised successfully. Total excision was achieved in both cases and as the tumor was firm to soft and vermian splitting was not required. Understanding the clinical features and a careful preoperative radiological examination is required to differentiate this tumor from more commonly occurring lesions at this location.

27118869|t|SLC transporters as a novel class of tumour suppressors: identity, function and molecular mechanisms.
27118869|a|The role of plasma membrane transporters in cancer is receiving increasing attention in recent years. Several transporters for essential nutrients are up-regulated in cancer and serve as tumour promoters. Transporters could also function as tumour suppressors. To date, four transporters belonging to the SLC gene family have been identified as tumour suppressors. SLC5A8 is a Na(+)-coupled transporter for monocarboxylates. Among its substrates are the bacterial fermentation products butyrate and propionate and the ubiquitous metabolite pyruvate. The tumour-suppressive function of this transporter relates to the ability of butyrate, propionate and pyruvate to inhibit histone deacetylases (HDAC). SLC5A8 functions as a tumour suppressor in most tissues studied thus far, and provides a molecular link to Warburg effect, a characteristic feature in most cancers. It also links colonic bacteria and dietary fibre to the host. SLC26A3 as a tumour suppressor is restricted to colon; it is a Cl(-)/HCO(-) 3 exchanger, facilitating the efflux of HCO(-) 3 The likely mechanism for the tumour-suppressive function of SLC26A3 is related to intracellular pH regulation. SLC39A1 is a Zn(2+) transporter and its role in tumour suppression has been shown in prostate. Zn(2+) is present at high concentrations in normal prostate where it elicits its tumour-suppressive function. SLC22A18 is possibly an organic cation transporter, but the identity of its physiological substrates is unknown. As such, there is no information on molecular pathways responsible for the tumour-suppressive function of this transporter. It is likely that additional SLC transporters will be discovered as tumour suppressors in the future.

27113736|t|Characterization of CDOM from urban waters in Northern-Northeastern China using excitation-emission matrix fluorescence and parallel factor analysis.
27113736|a|UNASSIGNED: Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) plays an important role in aquatic systems, but high concentrations of organic materials are considered pollutants. The fluorescent component characteristics of CDOM in urban waters sampled from Northern and Northeastern China were examined by excitation-emission matrix fluorescence and parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) to investigate the source and compositional changes of CDOM on both space and pollution levels. One humic-like (C1), one tryptophan-like component (C2), and one tyrosine-like component (C3) were identified by PARAFAC. Mean fluorescence intensities of the three CDOM components varied spatially and by pollution level in cities of Northern and Northeastern China during July-August, 2013 and 2014. Principal components analysis (PCA) was conducted to identify the relative distribution of all water samples. Cluster analysis (CA) was also used to categorize the samples into groups of similar pollution levels within a study area. Strong positive linear relationships were revealed between the CDOM absorption coefficients a(254) (R (2)   =   0.89, p   <   0.01); a(355) (R (2)   =   0.94, p   <   0.01); and the fluorescence intensity (F max) for the humic-like C1 component. A positive linear relationship (R (2)   =   0.77) was also exhibited between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the F max for the humic-like C1 component, but a relatively weak correlation (R (2)   =   0.56) was detected between DOC and the F max for the tryptophan-like component (C2). A strong positive correlation was observed between the F max for the tryptophan-like component (C2) and total nitrogen (TN) (R (2)   =   0.78), but moderate correlations were observed with ammonium-N (NH4-N) (R (2)   =   0.68), and chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) (R (2)   =   0.52). Therefore, the fluorescence intensities of CDOM components can be applied to monitor water quality in real time compared to that of traditional approaches. These results demonstrate that EEM-PARAFAC is useful to evaluate the dynamics of CDOM fluorescent components in urban waters from Northern and Northeastern China and this method has potential applications for monitoring urban water quality in different regions with various hydrological conditions and pollution levels.

27052033|t|Acanthocephalan Parasites (Acanthogyrus sp.) of Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) as Biosink of Lead (Pb) Contamination in a Philippine Freshwater Lake.
27052033|a|UNASSIGNED: The potential use of acanthocephalans as bioindicators of Lead (Pb) pollution in Sampaloc Lake, Laguna, Philippines was investigated. Nile tilapias (Oreochromis niloticus) were collected and Pb concentrations were determined in fish tissues and in their acanthocephalan parasites, Acanthogyrus sp. Significantly higher levels of Pb were detected in the parasites relative to the fish host tissues (p  =  0.001). Bioaccumulation capacity of the parasites against fish tissues were 102, 119, and 147 times higher than the fish intestine, liver, and muscles, respectively. Pb sensitivity of the parasites was quantified by exact logistic analysis showing higher odds of Pb detection ranging from 18 to 45 folds (p  =  0.001-0.009). Interestingly, infected fish showed significantly lower Pb concentration in their tissues compared to uninfected fish (p  =  0.001), suggesting parasites were able to sequester Pb and served as active biosinks. The Pb levels in the parasites were also hundred folds higher (988 times) relative to the ambient waters, indicating a potential role of fish parasites as metal biosinks in aquatic ecosystems.

27020780|t|Degradation of quinolone antibiotic, norfloxacin, in aqueous solution using gamma-ray irradiation.
27020780|a|UNASSIGNED: This study reports the efficiency of gamma-ray irradiation to degrade quinolone antibiotic, norfloxacin, in aqueous solution. Laboratory batch experiments were conducted to determine the "pseudo-first" order degradation kinetics of norfloxacin in the concentration ranges of 3.4-16.1  mg  L(-1) by gamma-ray irradiation. The dose constant was found to be dependent on the initial concentration of norfloxacin and gamma-ray irradiation dose rate (D r). The saturation of norfloxacin sample solutions with N2, air or N2O, and the presence of tert-butanol and 2-propanol showed that (   )OH played more crucial role in the degradation of norfloxacin. The second order rate constants of (   )OH, eaq (-), and (   )H with norfloxacin were calculated to be 8.81   *   10(9), 9.54   *   10(8), and 1.10   *   10(9)  M(-1)  s(-1), respectively. The effects of various additives including CO3 (2-), HCO3 (-), NO3 (-), NO2 (-), and thiourea and the pH of the medium on the degradation of norfloxacin were also investigated. Norfloxacin degradation was lower in surface water and wastewater than in ultrapure water. Several degradation byproducts of norfloxacin were identified from which the possible degradation pathway was proposed.

27066791|t|New insights for male infertility revealed by alterations in spermatic function and differential testicular expression of thyroid-related genes.
27066791|a|UNASSIGNED: The impact of thyroid hormone (TH) disorders on male reproductive biology has been a controversial issue for many years. Recently, we reported that hypothyroid male rats have a disruption of the seminiferous epithelium, which may compromise spermatogenesis. To improve the understanding of the reproductive pathogenesis of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, male Wistar rats that developed these dysfunctions in adulthood were used as an experimental model. We evaluated the sperm production, reserves, transit time, morphology, and functionality (acrosome integrity, plasma membrane integrity, and mitochondrial activity), and the testicular expression of the TH receptors (Thra1 and Thra2, Thrb1, and Thrb2), deiodinases (Dio2 and Dio3), and the Mct8 transporter (Slc16a2) were assessed by reverse transcription followed by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The results were evaluated statistically by ANOVA and Tukey HSD test (P  <  0.05). Hypothyroidism decreased the total and daily sperm productions and increased the sperm transit time through the epididymis, while the sperm functionality was reduced in both thyroid dysfunctions. Regarding the modulation of gene expression in the testis, hypothyroidism increased the expression of Thra1 and decreased the expression of Dio3, and hyperthyroidism increased the expression of Slc16a2. The observed alterations in spermatic production and function and in the expression of the TH receptor, deiodinase, and the TH transporter are suggestive of TH participation in spermatogenesis in adulthood.

27087174|t|Mitral Valve Replacement After Failed Mitral Ring Insertion With or Without Leaflet/Chordal Repair for Pure Mitral Regurgitation.
27087174|a|UNASSIGNED: Mitral repair operations for correction of pure mitral regurgitation (MR) are generally quite successful. Occasionally, however, the reparative procedure incompletely corrects the MR or the MR recurs. From March 1993 to January 2016, twenty nine patients had mitral valve replacement after the initial mitral repair operation, and observations in them were analyzed. All 29 patients at the repair operation had an annular ring inserted and later (<1  year in 6 and >1  year in 21) mitral valve replacement. The cause of the MR before the repair operation appears to have been prolapse in 16 patients (55%), secondary (functional) in 12 (41%) (ischemic in 5), and infective endocarditis which healed in 1 (3%). At the replacement operation the excised anterior mitral leaflet was thickened in all 29 patients. Some degree of stenosis appeared to have been present in 16 of the 29 patients before the replacement operation, although only 10 had an echocardiographic or hemodynamic recording of a transvalvular gradient; at least 11 patients had restricted motion of the posterior mitral leaflet; 10, ring dehiscence; 2, severe hemolysis; and 2, left ventricular outflow obstruction. In conclusion, there are multiple reasons for valve replacement after earlier mitral repair. Uniformly, at the time of the replacement, the mitral leaflets were thickened by fibrous tissue. Measurement of the area enclosed by the 360   rings and study of the excised leaflet suggest that the ring itself may have contributed to the leaflet scarring and development of some transmitral stenosis.

27106426|t|From 3-Dimensional Printing to 5-Dimensional Printing: Enhancing Thoracic Surgical Planning and  Resection of Complex Tumors.
27106426|a|PURPOSE: Three-dimensional (3D) printing of anatomic models for complex surgical cases improves patient and resident education, operative team planning, and guides the operation. Our group describes two additional dimensions. DESCRIPTION: The process of 5-dimensional (5D) printing was developed for surgical planning. Pretreatment computed tomography and positron emission tomography scans were reformatted and fused. Selected anatomy from these studies, along with posttreatment computed tomography and magnetic resonance images, were coregistered and segmented. This fused anatomy was converted into stereolithography files for 3D printing. EVALUATION: A patient presenting with a complex thoracic tumor was selected for 5D printing. 3D and 5D models were prepared to allow surgical teams to directly evaluate and compare the added benefits of information provided by printing in 5 dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: Printing 5D models in patients with complex thoracic pathology facilitates surgical planning, selecting margins for resection, anticipating potential difficulties, teaching for learners, and education for patients.

27060093|t|Resilience and Psychological Distress in Psychology and Medical Students.
27060093|a|OBJECTIVE: The authors investigated levels of resilience and psychological distress in medical and psychology students, factors that may affect these levels, the relationship between resilience and psychological distress, and student opinion on causes of stress and possible interventions. METHODS: A voluntary anonymous online survey was distributed to University of Adelaide medical and psychology students. RESULTS: Medical and psychology students (n   =   560; response rate   =   24.7%) had similar mean resilience and psychological distress scores, and 47.9% of medical students and 55.1% of psychology students were psychologically distressed. Higher levels of resilience were associated with lower levels of distress (p   <   0.001). Students supported resilience-based interventions, greater financial support, clearer learning objectives and more continuous assessment as potential means to reduce the effects of stress. CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of resilience were associated with lower levels of psychological distress. Further studies are required to determine the efficacy of resilience-based interventions in these groups.

27084995|t|A 20-year simulated climatology of global dust aerosol deposition.
27084995|a|UNASSIGNED: Based on a 20-year (1991-2010) simulation of dust aerosol deposition with the global climate model CAM5.1 (Community Atmosphere Model, version 5.1), the spatial and temporal variations of dust aerosol deposition were analyzed using climate statistical methods. The results indicated that the annual amount of global dust aerosol deposition was approximately 1161  31Mt, with a decreasing trend, and its interannual variation range of 2.70% over 1991-2010. The 20-year average ratio of global dust dry to wet depositions was 1.12, with interannual variation of 2.24%, showing the quantity of dry deposition of dust aerosol was greater than dust wet deposition. High dry deposition was centered over continental deserts and surrounding regions, while wet deposition was a dominant deposition process over the North Atlantic, North Pacific and northern Indian Ocean. Furthermore, both dry and wet deposition presented a zonal distribution. To examine the regional changes of dust aerosol deposition on land and sea areas, we chose the North Atlantic, Eurasia, northern Indian Ocean, North Pacific and Australia to analyze the interannual and seasonal variations of dust deposition and dry-to-wet deposition ratio. The deposition amounts of each region showed interannual fluctuations with the largest variation range at around 26.96% in the northern Indian Ocean area, followed by the North Pacific (16.47%), Australia (9.76%), North Atlantic (9.43%) and Eurasia (6.03%). The northern Indian Ocean also had the greatest amplitude of interannual variation in dry-to-wet deposition ratio, at 22.41%, followed by the North Atlantic (9.69%), Australia (6.82%), North Pacific (6.31%) and Eurasia (4.36%). Dust aerosol presented a seasonal cycle, with typically strong deposition in spring and summer and weak deposition in autumn and winter. The dust deposition over the northern Indian Ocean exhibited the greatest seasonal change range at about 118.00%, while the North Atlantic showed the lowest seasonal change at around 30.23%. The northern Indian Ocean had the greatest seasonal variation range of dry-to-wet deposition ratio, at around 74.57%, while Eurasia had the lowest, at around 12.14%.

27042398|t|Birth Control in Clinical Trials: Industry Survey of Current Use Practices, Governance, and Monitoring.
27042398|a|UNASSIGNED: The Health and Environmental Sciences Institute (HESI) Developmental and Reproductive Toxicology Technical Committee sponsored a pharmaceutical industry survey on current industry practices for contraception use during clinical trials. The objectives of the survey were to improve our understanding of the current industry practices for contraception requirements in clinical trials, the governance processes set up to promote consistency and/or compliance with contraception requirements, and the effectiveness of current contraception practices in preventing pregnancies during clinical trials. Opportunities for improvements in current practices were also considered. The survey results from 12 pharmaceutical companies identified significant variability among companies with regard to contraception practices and governance during clinical trials. This variability was due primarily to differences in definitions, areas of scientific uncertainty or misunderstanding, and differences in company approaches to enrollment in clinical trials. The survey also revealed that few companies collected data in a manner that would allow a retrospective understanding of the reasons for failure of birth control during clinical trials. In this article, suggestions are made for topics where regulatory guidance or scientific publications could facilitate best practice. These include provisions for a pragmatic definition of women of childbearing potential, guidance on how animal data can influence the requirements for male and female birth control, evidence-based guidance on birth control and pregnancy testing regimes suitable for low- and high-risk situations, plus practical methods to ascertain the risk of drug-drug interactions with hormonal contraceptives.

27100959|t|Utility of the ACE Inhibitor Captopril in Mitigating Radiation-associated Pulmonary Toxicity in Lung Cancer: Results From NRG Oncology RTOG 0123.
27100959|a|OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of NRG Oncology Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0123 was to test the ability of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril to alter the incidence of pulmonary damage after radiation therapy for lung cancer; secondary objectives included analyzing pulmonary cytokine expression, quality of life, and the long-term effects of captopril. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible patients included stage II-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer, stage I central non-small cell lung cancer, or limited-stage small cell. Patients who met eligibility for randomization at the end of radiotherapy received either captopril or standard care for 1 year. The captopril was to be escalated to 50 mg three times a day. Primary endpoint was incidence of grade 2+ radiation-induced pulmonary toxicity in the first year. RESULTS: Eighty-one patients were accrued between June 2003 and August 2007. Given the low accrual rate, the study was closed early. No significant safety issues were encountered. Eight patients were ineligible for registration or withdrew consent before randomization and 40 patients were not randomized postradiation. Major reasons for nonrandomization included patients' refusal and physician preference. Of the 33 randomized patients, 20 were analyzable (13 observation, 7 captopril). The incidence of grade 2+ pulmonary toxicity attributable to radiation therapy was 23% (3/13) in the observation arm and 14% (1/7) in the captopril arm. CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant resources and multiple amendments, NRG Oncology Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0123 was unable to test the hypothesis that captopril mitigates radiation-induced pulmonary toxicity. It did show the safety of such an approach and the use of newer angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors started during radiotherapy may solve the accrual problems.

27125412|t|Systematic review: What is the best first-line approach for cesarean section ectopic pregnancy?
27125412|a|This systematic review aims to analyze the case reports, case series, or clinical studies describing the women with cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy (CSEP), and thus, to determine the efficacy and safety of different primary treatment modalities in the management of CSEP. A thorough search of electronic databases showed that 274 articles on CSEP were published between January 1978 and April 2014. Systemic methotrexate, uterine artery embolization, dilatation and curettage (D_C), hysterotomy, and hysteroscopy were the most frequently adopted first-line approaches. The success rates of systemic methotrexate, uterine artery embolization, hysteroscopy, D_C, and hysterotomy were 8.7%, 18.3%, 39.1%, 61.6%, and 92.1%, respectively. The hysterectomy rates were 3.6%, 1.1%, 0.0%, 7.3%, and 1.7% in CSEP cases that were treated by systemic methotrexate, uterine artery embolization, hysteroscopy, D_C, and hysterotomy, respectively. The ability to achieve a subsequent term pregnancy is related to successful systemic methotrexate treatment (p  =  0.001) or hysterotomy (p  =  0.009). Future term pregnancy was significantly more frequent in the hysterotomy group (p  =  0.001). Hysteroscopy and laparoscopic hysterotomy are safe and efficient surgical procedures that can be adopted as primary treatment modalities for CSEP. Uterine artery embolization should be reserved for cases with significant bleeding and/or a high suspicion index for arteriovenous malformation. Systemic methotrexate and D_C are not recommended as first-line approaches for CSEP, as these procedures are associated with high complication and hysterectomy rates.

27060870|t|Associations of perceived neighborhood safety and crime with cardiometabolic risk factors among a population with type 2 diabetes.
27060870|a|UNASSIGNED: Little is known about how neighborhood crime may relate to health in diabetes patients. We examined associations between individuals' perceptions of neighborhood safety or violent crime and stress, physical activity, body mass index (BMI) or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in a sample (n=721) of adults (mean age:63) with diabetes. Self-reported neighborhood safety, violent crime, physical activity, and stress were collected and linked to clinical measures of BMI and HbA1c. Approximately 54% and 15% of patients reported neighborhood safety concerns and violent crimes, respectively. Any neighborhood safety concerns (b=1.14, 95% C.I. 0.04-2.24) and violent crime (b=2.04, 95% C.I. 0.34-3.73) were associated with BMI in adjusted analysis. Any violent crime was associated with class II-III obesity (BMI>= 35) (OR=1.34, 95% C.I.: 1.02, 1.75). There were no significant associations between neighborhood safety concerns or violent crime with stress, physical activity, or HbA1c. Neighborhood safety is associated with BMI and obesity. Further studies, including longitudinal designs, are needed to study how people with diabetes may be influenced by a sense of poor personal safety in their neighborhoods.

27004883|t|A critical appraisal of the zero-multipole method: Structural, thermodynamic, dielectric, and dynamical properties of a water system.
27004883|a|We performed extensive and strict tests for the reliability of the zero-multipole (summation) method (ZMM), which is a method for estimating the electrostatic interactions among charged particles in a classical physical system, by investigating a set of various physical quantities. This set covers a broad range of water properties, including the thermodynamic properties (pressure, excess chemical potential, constant volume/pressure heat capacity, isothermal compressibility, and thermal expansion coefficient), dielectric properties (dielectric constant and Kirkwood-G factor), dynamical properties (diffusion constant and viscosity), and the structural property (radial distribution function). We selected a bulk water system, the most important solvent, and applied the widely used TIP3P model to this test. In result, the ZMM works well for almost all cases, compared with the smooth particle mesh Ewald (SPME) method that was carefully optimized. In particular, at cut-off radius of 1.2 nm, the recommended choices of ZMM parameters for the TIP3P system are a  <= 1 nm(-1) for the splitting parameter and l = 2 or l = 3 for the order of the multipole moment. We discussed the origin of the deviations of the ZMM and found that they are intimately related to the deviations of the equilibrated densities between the ZMM and SPME, while the magnitude of the density deviations is very small.

27001600|t|Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm presenting with recurrent pancreatitis: a report of a painful 3-decade-long history.
27001600|a|Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm represents the most common pancreatic cystic neoplasm and harbours significant malignant potential. Duct obliteration can lead to recurrent episodes of pancreatic inflammation mimicking acute and chronic pancreatitis. We report a case of a patient with multiple episodes of idiopathic pancreatitis occurring over a period of three decades. Following admission with severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding, the patient was diagnosed as having invasive pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Examination of the surgical specimen confirmed an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with multiple foci of invasive adenocarcinoma. This case is of significant interest, highlighting the long delay until diagnosis seen in this situation. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm should be considered in the presence of recurrent acute or chronic pancreatitis of unknown aetiology.

27020399|t|Production of carboxylates from high rate activated sludge through fermentation.
27020399|a|UNASSIGNED: The aim of this work was to study the key parameters affecting fermentation of high rate activated A-sludge to carboxylates, including pH, temperature, inoculum, sludge composition and iron content. The maximum volatile fatty acids production was 141mgCg(-1) VSSfed, at pH 7. Subsequently the potential for carboxylate and methane production for A-sludge from four different plants at pH 7 and 35  C were compared. Initial BOD of the sludge appeared to be key determining carboxylate yield from A-sludge. Whereas methanogenesis could be correlated linearly to the quantity of ferric used for coagulation, fermentation did not show a dependency on iron presence. This difference may enable a strategy whereby A-stage sludge is separated to achieve fermentation, and iron dosing for phosphate removal is only implemented at the B-stage.

27020415|t|[Symptomatic lumbar incisional hernia after open nephrectomy: What are the risk factors?]
27020415|a|OBJECTIVE: Lumbar incisional hernias after open nephrectomy are rare but can lead to aesthetic disorder, discomfort or intestinal obstruction. The aim of the study is to highlight their risk factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The characteristics of patients who suffered from symptomatic and surgically treated lumbar incisionnal hernia after open nephrectomy (study group "GE") were compared to those of patients who underwent open nephrectomy without postoperative incisional hernia (control group "GT") using the Student's t test and Mann-Whitney test (statistical significance P value<0.05). GT patients were randomly selected with a 1/4 ratio (1  lumbar incisionnal hernia vs 4 controls). RESULTS: From 2004 to 2014, 417 open nephrectomies were performed in one university hospital. Forty-five patients were included: 9  in GE and 36 in GT. There was no statistically significant difference between GT and GE for weight, height, body mass index (BMI), emergency, partial nephrectomy, laterality, rib resection, laparoscopic conversion to open surgery, postoperative complications, smoking, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular history, obesity and sex, but there was a statistically significant difference for age, operative time, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe obesity (BMI>35) with, respectively, P=0.05, P=0.02, P=0.04 and P=0.02. CONCLUSION: Risk factors for lumbar incisional hernia after open nephrectomy are age, operative time, severe obesity and COPD. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 5.

27166369|t|GPCR-ModSim: A comprehensive web based solution for modeling G-protein coupled receptors.
27166369|a|UNASSIGNED: GPCR-ModSim (http://open.gpcr-modsim.org) is a centralized and easy to use service dedicated to the structural modeling of G-protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs). 3D molecular models can be generated from amino acid sequence by homology-modeling techniques, considering different receptor conformations. GPCR-ModSim includes a membrane insertion and molecular dynamics (MD) equilibration protocol, which can be used to refine the generated model or any GPCR structure uploaded to the server, including if desired non-protein elements such as orthosteric or allosteric ligands, structural waters or ions. We herein revise the main characteristics of GPCR-ModSim and present new functionalities. The templates used for homology modeling have been updated considering the latest structural data, with separate profile structural alignments built for inactive, partially-active and active groups of templates. We have also added the possibility to perform multiple-template homology modeling in a unique and flexible way. Finally, our new MD protocol considers a series of distance restraints derived from a recently identified conserved network of helical contacts, allowing for a smoother refinement of the generated models which is particularly advised when there is low homology to the available templates. GPCR- ModSim has been tested on the GPCR Dock 2013 competition with satisfactory results.

27044113|t|Unraveling the dynamics and structure of functionalized self-assembled monolayers on gold using 2D IR spectroscopy and MD simulations.
27044113|a|UNASSIGNED: Functionalized self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are the focus of ongoing investigations because they can be chemically tuned to control their structure and dynamics for a wide variety of applications, including electrochemistry, catalysis, and as models of biological interfaces. Here we combine reflection 2D infrared vibrational echo spectroscopy (R-2D IR) and molecular dynamics simulations to determine the relationship between the structures of functionalized alkanethiol SAMs on gold surfaces and their underlying molecular motions on timescales of tens to hundreds of picoseconds. We find that at higher head group density, the monolayers have more disorder in the alkyl chain packing and faster dynamics. The dynamics of alkanethiol SAMs on gold are much slower than the dynamics of alkylsiloxane SAMs on silica. Using the simulations, we assess how the different molecular motions of the alkyl chain monolayers give rise to the dynamics observed in the experiments.

27077211|t|Is There Bias against Simulation in Microsurgery Training?
27077211|a|UNASSIGNED: Background   While other surgical specialties have embraced virtual reality simulation for training and recertification, microsurgery has lagged. This study aims to assess the opinions of microsurgeons on the role of simulation in microsurgery assessment and training. Methods   We surveyed faculty members of the American Society of Reconstructive Microsurgery to ascertain opinions on their use of simulation in training and opinions about the utility of simulation for skills acquisition, teaching, and skills assessment. The 21-question survey was disseminated online to 675 members. Results   Eighty-nine members completed the survey for a 13.2% response rate. Few microsurgeons have experience with high-fidelity simulation, and opinions on its utility are internally inconsistent. Although 84% of respondents could not identify a reason why simulation would not be useful, only 24% believed simulation is a useful measure of clinical performance. Nearly three-fourths of respondents were skeptical that simulation would improve their skills. Ninety-four percent had no experience with simulator-based assessment. Conclusion   Simulation has been shown to improve skills acquisition in microsurgery, but our survey suggests that unfamiliarity may foster bias against the technology. Failure to incorporate simulation may adversely affect training and may put surgeons at a disadvantage should these technologies be adopted for recertification by regulatory agencies.

27038469|t|Environmental Social Stress, Paranoia and Psychosis Liability: A Virtual Reality Study.
27038469|a|UNASSIGNED: The impact of social environments on mental states is difficult to assess, limiting the understanding of which aspects of the social environment contribute to the onset of psychotic symptoms and how individual characteristics moderate this outcome. This study aimed to test sensitivity to environmental social stress as a mechanism of psychosis using Virtual Reality (VR) experiments. Fifty-five patients with recent onset psychotic disorder, 20 patients at ultra high risk for psychosis, 42 siblings of patients with psychosis, and 53 controls walked 5 times in a virtual bar with different levels of environmental social stress. Virtual social stressors were population density, ethnic density and hostility. Paranoia about virtual humans and subjective distress in response to virtual social stress exposures were measured with State Social Paranoia Scale (SSPS) and self-rated momentary subjective distress (SUD), respectively. Pre-existing (subclinical) symptoms were assessed with the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE), Green Paranoid Thoughts Scale (GPTS) and the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS). Paranoia and subjective distress increased with degree of social stress in the environment. Psychosis liability and pre-existing symptoms, in particular negative affect, positively impacted the level of paranoia and distress in response to social stress. These results provide experimental evidence that heightened sensitivity to environmental social stress may play an important role in the onset and course of psychosis.

27000118|t|Human contribution to trace elements in urban areas as measured in holm oak (Quercus ilex L.) bark.
27000118|a|UNASSIGNED: The effect of human activities on the presence of trace elements in the atmosphere was evaluated by analyzing samples of holm oak bark, collected in Italy in a large city, in a small town, and in a reference area, scarcely inhabited. In all cases, point sources of pollution were excluded (e.g., industries and incinerators). The concentrations of As, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The element concentrations in the small town are not different from the reference area, except for Pb and Cu, while the samples collected in the large city show higher concentrations of Co, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn with respect to the rural area. In particular, the Pb levels in the large city are approximately 16 times higher than in the reference site, and five times higher than in the small town. Most element concentrations are correlated in the large city, while in the reference site, only a few significant correlations between elements were found. Even in the absence of specific sources of pollution, populations living in big cities are exposed to higher concentrations of trace elements than those living in rural environments or in small urban centers.

27007645|t|Continuous measurement of enzymatic kinetics in droplet flow for point-of-care monitoring.
27007645|a|UNASSIGNED: Droplet microfluidics is ideally suited to continuous biochemical analysis, requiring low sample volumes and offering high temporal resolution. Many biochemical assays are based on enzymatic reactions, the kinetics of which can be obtained by probing droplets at multiple points over time. Here we present a miniaturised multi-detector flow cell to analyse enzyme kinetics in droplets, with an example application of continuous glucose measurement. Reaction rates and Michaelis-Menten kinetics can be quantified for each individual droplet and unknown glucose concentrations can be accurately determined (errors <5%). Droplets can be probed continuously giving short sample-to-result time (   30 s) measurement. In contrast to previous reports of multipoint droplet measurement (all of which used bulky microscope-based setups) the flow cell presented here has a small footprint and uses low-powered, low-cost components, making it ideally suited for use in field-deployable devices.

27127597|t|Time Perception Mechanisms at Central Nervous System.
27127597|a|The five senses have specific ways to receive environmental information and lead to central nervous system. The perception of time is the sum of stimuli associated with cognitive processes and environmental changes. Thus, the perception of time requires a complex neural mechanism and may be changed by emotional state, level of attention, memory and diseases. Despite this knowledge, the neural mechanisms of time perception are not yet fully understood. The objective is to relate the mechanisms involved the neurofunctional aspects, theories, executive functions and pathologies that contribute the understanding of temporal perception. Articles form 1980 to 2015 were searched by using the key themes: neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, theories, time cells, memory, schizophrenia, depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and Parkinson's disease combined with the term perception of time. We evaluated 158 articles within the inclusion criteria for the purpose of the study. We conclude that research about the holdings of the frontal cortex, parietal, basal ganglia, cerebellum and hippocampus have provided advances in the understanding of the regions related to the perception of time. In neurological and psychiatric disorders, the understanding of time depends on the severity of the diseases and the type of tasks.

27128180|t|Design, synthesis and antiproliferative activity of novel 5-nitropyrimidine-2,4-diamine derivatives bearing alkyl acetate moiety.
27128180|a|UNASSIGNED: In order to discover new anticancer drug leads, a series of novel alkylamino pyrimidine derivatives were designed and synthesized based on our previous work via a ring-opening strategy. Biological evaluation with four human cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, A549, HepG2, and MCF-7) showed that most of these compounds possessed moderate to potent antiproliferative activities. The most promising compound 7w displayed a three-fold improvement compared with commercial anticancer drug fluorouracil in inhibiting HepG2 cell proliferation with IC50 value of 10.37   M. Moreover, flow-activated cell sorting analysis suggested that compound 7w mainly arrested HepG2 cells in G2/M stage. Hence, it could serve as a promising lead for the design of novel anticancer small-molecule drugs.

27127029|t|Synthesis and characterization of polycaprolactone urethane hollow fiber membranes as small diameter vascular grafts.
27127029|a|The design of bioresorbable synthetic small diameter (<6mm) vascular grafts (SDVGs) capable of sustaining long-term patency and endothelialization is a daunting challenge in vascular tissue engineering. Here, we synthesized a family of biocompatible and biodegradable polycaprolactone (PCL) urethane macromers to fabricate hollow fiber membranes (HFMs) as SDVG candidates, and characterized their mechanical properties, degradability, hemocompatibility, and endothelial development. The HFMs had smooth surfaces and porous internal structures. Their tensile stiffness ranged from 0.09 to 0.11N/mm and their maximum tensile force from 0.86 to 1.03N, with minimum failure strains of approximately 130%. Permeability varied from 1 to 14*10(-6)cm/s, burst pressures from 1158 to 1468mmHg, and compliance from 0.52 to 1.48%/100mmHg. The suture retention forces ranged from 0.55 to 0.81N. HFMs had slow degradation profiles, with 15 to 30% degradation after 8weeks. Human endothelial cells proliferated well on the HFMs, creating stable cell layer coverage. Hemocompatibility studies demonstrated low hemolysis (<2%), platelet activation, and protein adsorption. There were no significant differences in the hemocompatibility of HFMs in the absence and presence of endothelial layers. These encouraging results suggest great promise of our newly developed materials and biodegradable elastomeric HFMs as SDVG candidates.

27103021|t|Synthesis of 18F-Tetrafluoroborate (18F-TFB) via Radiofluorination of Boron Trifluoride and Evaluation in a Murine C6-Glioma Tumor Model.
27103021|a|UNASSIGNED: The sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) is under investigation as a reporter for noninvasive imaging of gene expression. Although(18)F-tetrafluoroborate ((18)F-TFB,(18)F-BF4 (-)) has shown promise as a PET imaging probe for NIS, the current synthesis method employing isotopic exchange gives suboptimal radiochemical yield and specific activity. The aim of this study was to synthesize(18)F-TFB via direct radiofluorination on boron trifluoride (BF3) to enhance both labeling yield and specific activity, and evaluation of specific activity influence on tumor uptake. METHODS: An automated synthesis of(18)F-TFB was developed whereby cyclotron-produced(18)F-fluoride was trapped on a quaternary methyl ammonium anion exchange (QMA) cartridge, then allowed to react with BF3freshly pre-formulated in petroleum ether / tetrahydrofuran (THF) (50:1). The resultant(18)F-TFB product was retained on the QMA cartridge. After rinsing the cartridge with THF and water,(18)F-TFB was eluted from the cartridge with isotonic saline, passing through three neutral alumina cartridges and a sterilizing filter. Preclinical imaging studies with(18)F-TFB were performed in athymic mice bearing NIS-expressing C6 glioma subcutaneous xenografted tumors to determine influence of specific activity on tumor uptake. RESULTS: Under optimized conditions,(18)F-TFB was synthesized in radiochemical yield of 20.0    0.7% ( ITALIC! n= 3, uncorrected for decay) and >98% radiochemical purity in a synthesis time of 10 min. Specific activities of 8.84    0.56 GBq/  mol ( ITALIC! n= 3) were achieved from starting [(18)F]fluoride radioactivities of 40-44 GBq. An avid uptake of(18)F-TFB was observed in human NIS (hNIS) expressing C6 glioma xenografts as well as expected NIS-mediated uptake in thyroid and stomach. There was a positive association between the uptake of(18)F-TFB in hNIS-expressing tumor and specific activity. CONCLUSION: A rapid, practical, and high-specific activity synthesis of the NIS reporter probe(18)F-TFB was achieved via direct radiofluorination on BF3using an automated synthesis system. The synthesis of high specific activity(18)F-TFB should enable future clinical studies with hNIS gene reporter viral constructs.

27084997|t|Population pharmacokinetic analysis to recommend the optimal dose of udenafil in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment.
27084997|a|AIMS: The aim of this study was to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model of udenafil and its active metabolite, DA-8164, in healthy subjects and patients with hepatic impairment (HI) and to estimate the optimal dosing recommendations for patients with HI. METHODS: An open-label, three-parallel group, age- and weight-matched control study was conducted in 18 subjects, healthy subjects (n   =   6) and patients with mild (Child-Pugh class A, n   =   6) and moderate HI (Child-Pugh class B, n   =   6). Serial blood were collected for up to 72   h after a single administration of udenafil 100   mg. A population PK model was developed using nonlinear mixed effects modelling (NONMEM, ver. 7.2). The simulated data from the final PK model and original data of healthy subjects were compared to identify the optimal dose for patients with HI. RESULTS: A two-compartment model for both udenafil and DA-8164 best described the data. Prothrombin time on metabolic clearance of udenafil to DA-8164 was included in the final model as a covariate. Compared to the AUClast value after administration of udenafil 100   mg to healthy subjects, the geometric mean ratios (95% confidence interval) after 100-mg- and 75-mg-udenafil administration were 1.21 (1.10-1.32) and 0.74 (0.67-0.81) in patients with mild HI, respectively. Meanwhile, those were 1.55 (1.43-1.67) and 1.02 (0.92-1.12) in patients with moderate HI, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the recommended doses of udenafil are 100   mg and 75   mg in patients with mild and moderate HI, respectively.

27096778|t|The dose makes the poison: from glutamate-mediated neurogenesis to neuronal atrophy and depression.
27096778|a|UNASSIGNED: Experimental evidence has demonstrated that glutamate is an essential factor for neurogenesis, whereas another line of research postulates that excessive glutamatergic neurotransmission is associated with the pathogenesis of depression. The present review shows that such paradox can be explained within the framework of hormesis, defined as biphasic dose responses. Low glutamate levels activate adaptive stress responses that include proteins that protect neurons against more severe stress. Conversely, abnormally high levels of glutamate, resulting from increased release and/or decreased removal, cause neuronal atrophy and depression. The dysregulation of the glutamatergic transmission in depression could be underlined by several factors including a decreased inhibition (y-aminobutyric acid or serotonin) or an increased excitation (primarily within the glutamatergic system). Experimental evidence shows that the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) and a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors (AMPAR) can exert two opposite effects on neurogenesis and neuron survival depending on the synaptic or extrasynaptic concentration. Chronic stress, which usually underlies experimental and clinical depression, enhances glutamate release. This overactivates NMDA receptors (NMDAR) and consequently impairs AMPAR activity. Various studies show that treatment with antidepressants decreases plasma glutamate levels in depressed individuals and regulates glutamate receptors by reducing NMDAR function by decreasing the expression of its subunits and by potentiating AMPAR-mediated transmission. Additionally, it has been shown that chronic treatment with antidepressants having divergent mechanisms of action (including tricyclics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and ketamine) markedly reduced depolarization-evoked glutamate release in the hippocampus. These data, taken together, suggest that the glutamatergic system could be a final common pathway for antidepressant treatments.

27085653|t|Second-generation versus first-generation drug-eluting stents in saphenous vein graftdisease: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
27085653|a|BACKGROUND: Second-generation drug-eluting stents (DESs) have become increasingly popular devices for patients with saphenous vein graft (SVG) disease. Second-generation DESs were designed to have more safety and efficacy than first-generation DES, but clinical outcomes in SVG disease remain conflicting. METHODS AND RESULTS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified when comparing second- versus first-generation DESs in SVG disease. The main endpoint was all-cause death. The time of follow-up was at least 30days. The secondary endpoints were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), target vessel revascularization (TVR), target lesion revascularization (TLR), myocardial infarction (MI), and stent thrombosis. These endpoints were assessed at 30days, 12months and 24months. Four RCTs with 1077 SVG patients undergoing the implantation of DES were collected in the current meta-analysis. As a result, second-generation DES-treated patients had the significantly lower MACE rates at 12months (P=0.03; OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.49,0.97). No differences in two groups were seen in all-cause death, MI, TVR, stent thrombosis and TLR. CONCLUSIONS: Our limited evidence indicated that, second-generation DES in SVG patients, compared with first-generation DES, offered similar levels of safety, but were more effective than the former one.

27032431|a|UNASSIGNED: Zika virus is endemic in several parts of the world. February 1, 2016 Zika virus was declared a public health emergency by the WHO. This declaration is mainly due to a convincing association between Zika virus infection during pregnancy and birth defects, like microcephaly, among some of the newborns. Imported cases of Zika virus infection to North America, Europe and Denmark have been described. The infection in itself is mild and self-limiting. The available diagnostic methods are under development, validation and evaluation. In Denmark, some promising diagnostics are available at Statens Serum Institut.

27032218|t|Antimicrobial Constituents and Effects of Blended Eucalyptus, Rosemary, Patchouli, Pine, and Cajuput Essential Oils.
27032218|a|The synergistic antimicrobial activities of blended essential oil preparations composed of eucalyptus, rosemary, patchouli, pine and cajuput oils were evaluated against various pathogenic microorganisms. They exhibited antimicrobial activity in the agar disc diffusion assay against the Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidenidis, the Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the yeast, Candida albicans. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of these preparations was evaluated by the broth microdilution method. We found that the best synergistic antibacterial preparation (the sum of fractional inhibitory concentrations,   fic < 1) was eucalyptus, rosemary, and mineral oils (volume ratio 4:4:2) without patchouli, pine or cajuput oils added, while most preparations showed an antagonistic anticandidal effect (  fic > 1). The blended essential oil preparations were characterized for their components by GC/MS, and contained 1,8-cineole as a major component. However, the preparation containing the highest amount of 1,8-cineole did not exhibit the best synergistic effect, which was shown by the preparation comprising the highest amount of a-pinene. Hence, we concluded that the differential antibacterial effect of either blended oil preparations or single/pure essential oils was influenced by the amount of a-pinene and the number of active components in either the blended preparations or single/pure essential oils.

27166322|t|Measuring Investment in Learning: Can Electrocardiogram Provide an Indication of Cognitive Effort During Learning?
27166322|a|Heart rate variability (i.e., low frequency:high frequency ratio) was measured to differentiate invested cognitive effort during the acquisition and retention of a novel task. Participants (12 male, M   =   25.1 year, SD   =   3.6; 12 female, M   =   22.8 year, SD   =   1.1) were required to produce Braille equivalents of English letter primes on a standardized keyboard in proactive or retroactive conditions (groups, each n   =   12). The correct Braille response was either provided before (i.e., proactively) or after (i.e., retroactively) the participant's response. During acquisition, participants in the proactive group demonstrated shorter study time, greater recall success, and reported lower cognitive investment. Participants in the proactive and retroactive groups did not statistically differ in heart rate variability. For retention, the retroactive group showed greater recall success, lower perceived cognitive effort investment, and lower heart rate variability. The results highlight the usefulness of heart rate variability in discriminating the cognitive effort invested for a recently acquired skill.

27167775|t|A competitive Upconversion-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ULISA) for the rapid and sensitive detection of diclofenac.
27167775|a|UNASSIGNED: Photon-upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) emit light of shorter wavelength under near-infrared excitation and thus avoid optical background interference. We have exploited this unique photophysical feature to establish a sensitive competitive immunoassay for the detection of the pharmaceutical micropollutant diclofenac (DCF) in water. The so-called upconversion-linked immunosorbent assay (ULISA) was critically dependent on the design of the upconversion luminescent detection label. Silica-coated UCNPs (50 nm in diameter) exposing carboxyl groups on the surface were conjugated to a secondary anti-IgG antibody. We investigated the structure and monodispersity of the nanoconjugates in detail. Using a highly affine anti-DCF primary antibody, the optimized ULISA reached a detection limit of 0.05 ng DCF per mL. This performance comes close to a conventional ELISA without the need for an enzyme-mediated signal amplification step. The ULISA was further employed for analyzing drinking and surface water samples and the results were consistent with a conventional ELISA as well as LC-MS.

27052512|t|Management of multiple cerebral arteriovenous malformations in a non-pediatric population.
27052512|a|BACKGROUND: The occurrence of concomitant multiple cerebral arteriovenous malformations (mAVMs) is often associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) or craniofacial arteriovenous metameric syndrome (CAMS) and frequently occurs in the pediatric population. METHODS: Between 1995 and 2013, demographic, clinical, and angiographic data of cerebral AVMs have been prospectively collected. We retrospectively analyzed data of patients presenting multiple cerebral AVMs. RESULTS: Six patients (mean age, 44  years, male-to-female ratio, 5) presented an angiographic diagnosis of cerebral mAVMs. Only one of them was known to have a HHT. Five patients presented two cerebral AVMs and one patient had three. Three AVMs (23.1  %) presented bleeding at admission. Three patients had supratentorial mAVMs only and the three others had supra and infratentorial AVMs. Only one patient suffered from bleeding of more than one of his mAVMs with an interval of 23  years. CONCLUSIONS: For asymptomatic AVMs discovered incidentally without angiographic bleeding risk, we propose a therapeutic abstention. In case of AVM rupture and bleeding, the other "associated" AVMs (discovered through a complete angiographic assessment) should also be treated if they are not located in an eloquent area and if the treatment does not present technical difficulties. AVMs with a history of bleeding or associated to angiographic risks have to be treated more aggressively.

27023695|t|Patterns and Economic Burden of Hospitalizations and Exacerbations Among Patients Diagnosed with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.
27023695|a|BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare and fatal restrictive respiratory disease under the idiopathic lung disease (ILD) class. IPF is a form of chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonia and has more scarring, less inflammation, and poorer prognosis than most other ILD forms. Exacerbation of IPF is rapid, with unpredictable deterioration of lung function, and is associated with short-term mortality. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) evidence-based guidelines for diagnosis and management of IPF reports that the incidence of acute exacerbations is between 5%-10%. Limited real-world evidence has been identified in the United States that assesses patterns of hospitalization, exacerbation of IPF, and the associated economic burden. OBJECTIVES: To (a) characterize patients newly diagnosed with IPF and (b) examine incidence rates and costs of all-cause hospitalizations, IPF-related hospitalizations, and exacerbations. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed with a national commercial claims database from calendar years 2006 to 2011. Newly diagnosed IPF patients were identified with either >=  2 claims for idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis (IFA) or >=  1 claim for IFA and >=  1 claim for postinflam-matory pulmonary fibrosis and a lung biopsy or thoracic high-resolution computed tomography within 90 days of the first claim for IFA (index date). IPF-related hospitalizations and possible IPF exacerbations were defined based on diagnoses recorded on event claims. Frequency, incidence rate, duration of events, and associated costs from the third-party payer's perspective were estimated. RESULTS: Among 1,735 identified IPF patients, 38.6% had at least 1 all-cause hospitalization; 10.8% had IPF-related hospitalizations; 4.6% had suspected IPF exacerbations leading to hospitalization; and 72.1% had suspected IPF exacerbations leading to urgent outpatient visits during the 1-year post-index period. Incident rates for these 4 events were 83 (95% CI = 79-88), 17 (95% CI = 14-19), 7 (95% CI = 6-9), and 277 (95% CI = 269-286) per 100 person-years, respectively. Average costs per event were  13,987 (SD =  41,988),  16,812 (SD =  66,399),  14,731 (SD =  85,468), and  444 (SD =  1,481), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalizations and possible exacerbations among patients with IPF were costly. Appropriate management of IPF needs to be considered to help slow IPF disease progression.

27103204|t|Serum Concentrations of Symmetric Dimethylarginine and Creatinine in Dogs with Naturally Occurring Chronic Kidney Disease.
27103204|a|BACKGROUND: Serum concentrations of symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) detected chronic kidney disease (CKD) in cats an average of 17.0 months before serum creatinine (Cr) concentrations increased above the reference interval. OBJECTIVES: To report on the utility of measuring serum SDMA concentrations in dogs for detection of CKD before diagnosis by measurement of serum Cr. ANIMALS: CKD dogs (n = 19) included those persistently azotemic for >= 3 months (n = 5), dogs that were azotemic at the time of death (n = 4), and nonazotemic dogs (n = 10). CKD dogs were compared with healthy control dogs (n = 20). METHODS: Retrospective study, whereby serum Cr concentrations were determined by enzymatic colorimetry and serum SDMA concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in dogs with necropsy confirmed CKD. RESULTS: Serum SDMA increased before serum Cr in 17 of 19 dogs (mean, 9.8 months; range, 2.2-27.0 months). Duration of elevations in serum SDMA concentrations before the dog developed azotemia (N = 1) or before the dog died (N = 1) was not determined. Serum SDMA and Cr concentrations were linearly related (r = 0.84; P < .001). Serum SDMA (r = -0.80) and serum Cr (r = -0.89) concentrations were significantly related to glomerular filtration rate (both P < .001). CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Using serum SDMA as a biomarker for CKD allows earlier detection of kidney dysfunction in dogs than does measurement of serum Cr. Earlier detection might be desirable for initiating renoprotective interventions that slow progression of kidney disease.

27102784|t|Differential Sensitivity of Madin-darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) Cells to Epinephrine.
27102784|a|Catecholamines regulate a variety of cellular functions in the mammalian kidney. The present study was aimed to investigate the differential sensitivity of Madin-Darby Kidney Cells (MDCK cells) to epinephrine in a dose-dependent manner. The loss of adhesion and altered cell shape were observed in MDCK cells. The presence of apoptosis and necrosis were studied by the fluorescence microscope and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (CLSM). Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis showed several surface microvilli, and cells were rounded having ruffled and crenated surface. Agarose gel electrophoresis study showed the presence of smearing, which further confirms the occurrence of necrosis. The fluorescence staining study showed the increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. Up-regulation of p53, bax, and caspase 3 mRNA expressions was evidenced by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Caspase 3 activity was also increased in epinephrine treated cells. Our experimental results do not imply that the epinephrine should not be used in the clinical treatments. However, our results add a research note of caution on the possible cytotoxic effect of maximal doses of epinephrine over a prolonged time.

27102292|t|Evaluation of a silver-impregnated coating to inhibit colonization of orthopaedic implants by biofilm forming methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius.
27102292|a|OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the in vitro antibacterial activity of a silver-impregnated coating against a biofilm-forming strain of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP). METHODS: A clinical MRSP isolate sourced from a failed canine knee implant was evaluated for biofilm production and used in the present study. Using a standard test method and a clinically approved titanium substrate, the antimicrobial activity of a novel silver plasma coating was determined at two times: five minutes after inoculation of the specimens (T0) and after 24 hours of incubation (T24). Scanning electron microscopy was used to evaluate the biofilm formation on specimens. RESULTS: The tested clinical MRSP isolate was classified as a strong biofilm producer. The silver coating significantly reduced the MRSP growth more than four log steps compared to the non-coated specimens and showed more than 99.98% reduction in the number of colony forming units after 24 hours. Scanning electron microscopy images revealed that silver-coated surfaces did not manifest detectable biofilm, while biofilm formation was readily observed on the control specimens. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The silver coating exhibited excellent activity against the multidrug resistant biofilm-forming MRSP isolate. The next stage of this work will involve testing in an animal model of orthopaedic infection. Positive results from animal studies would support the introduction of the silver plasma coating as a new strategy for preventing implant contamination, biofilm formation, and surgical infection in dogs undergoing orthopaedic surgery.

27102147|t|Musculoskeletal modelling in dogs: challenges and future perspectives.
27102147|a|UNASSIGNED: Musculoskeletal models have proven to be a valuable tool in human orthopaedics research. Recently, veterinary research started taking an interest in the computer modelling approach to understand the forces acting upon the canine musculoskeletal system. While many of the methods employed in human musculoskeletal models can applied to canine musculoskeletal models, not all techniques are applicable. This review summarizes the important parameters necessary for modelling, as well as the techniques employed in human musculoskeletal models and the limitations in transferring techniques to canine modelling research. The major challenges in future canine modelling research are likely to centre around devising alternative techniques for obtaining maximal voluntary contractions, as well as finding scaling factors to adapt a generalized canine musculoskeletal model to represent specific breeds and subjects.

27027515|t|Uncovering Local Trends in Genetic Effects of Multiple Phenotypes via Functional Linear Models.
27027515|a|Recent technological advances equipped researchers with capabilities that go beyond traditional genotyping of loci known to be polymorphic in a general population. Genetic sequences of study participants can now be assessed directly. This capability removed technology-driven bias toward scoring predominantly common polymorphisms and let researchers reveal a wealth of rare and sample-specific variants. Although the relative contributions of rare and common polymorphisms to trait variation are being debated, researchers are faced with the need for new statistical tools for simultaneous evaluation of all variants within a region. Several research groups demonstrated flexibility and good statistical power of the functional linear model approach. In this work we extend previous developments to allow inclusion of multiple traits and adjustment for additional covariates. Our functional approach is unique in that it provides a nuanced depiction of effects and interactions for the variables in the model by representing them as curves varying over a genetic region. We demonstrate flexibility and competitive power of our approach by contrasting its performance with commonly used statistical tools and illustrate its potential for discovery and characterization of genetic architecture of complex traits using sequencing data from the Dallas Heart Study.

27029303|t|The Effects of Two Novel Copper-Based Formulations on Helicobacter pylori.
27029303|a|We investigated the effects of two novel copper-based inorganic formulations for their activity against 60 isolates of Helicobacter pylori (Hp). The two copper-based formulations were tested against three NCTC Helicobacter pylori isolates and 57 clinical strains isolated from the UK and Italy in time-kill assays. Both copper-based formulations were bio-cidal against all Helicobacter pylori strains tested reducing the viable count by 4-5 log within 2 h. These two copper-based anti-microbial agents deserve further study in relation to the treatment of H. pylori-related gastric disease.

27038556|t|De novo assembly and characterization of the Trichuris trichiura adult worm transcriptome using Ion Torrent sequencing.
27038556|a|UNASSIGNED: Infection with helminthic parasites, including the soil-transmitted helminth Trichuris trichiura (human whipworm), has been shown to modulate host immune responses and, consequently, to have an impact on the development and manifestation of chronic human inflammatory diseases. De novo derivation of helminth proteomes from sequencing of transcriptomes will provide valuable data to aid identification of parasite proteins that could be evaluated as potential immunotherapeutic molecules in near future. Herein, we characterized the transcriptome of the adult stage of the human whipworm T. trichiura, using next-generation sequencing technology and a de novo assembly strategy. Nearly 17.6 million high-quality clean reads were assembled into 6414 contiguous sequences, with an N50 of 1606bp. In total, 5673 protein-encoding sequences were confidentially identified in the T. trichiura adult worm transcriptome; of these, 1013 sequences represent potential newly discovered proteins for the species, most of which presenting orthologs already annotated in the related species T. suis. A number of transcripts representing probable novel non-coding transcripts for the species T. trichiura were also identified. Among the most abundant transcripts, we found sequences that code for proteins involved in lipid transport, such as vitellogenins, and several chitin-binding proteins. Through a cross-species expression analysis of gene orthologs shared by T. trichiura and the closely related parasites T. suis and T. muris it was possible to find twenty-six protein-encoding genes that are consistently highly expressed in the adult stages of the three helminth species. Additionally, twenty transcripts could be identified that code for proteins previously detected by mass spectrometry analysis of protein fractions of the whipworm somatic extract that present immunomodulatory activities. Five of these transcripts were amongst the most highly expressed protein-encoding sequences in the T. trichiura adult worm. Besides, orthologs of proteins demonstrated to have potent immunomodulatory properties in related parasitic helminths were also predicted from the T. trichiura de novo assembled transcriptome.

27121104|t|Energy redistribution dynamics in triarylamine-triarylborane containing hexaarylbenzenes.
27121104|a|UNASSIGNED: Two hexaarylbenzenes (HAB) 1 and 2 each decorated by three triarylamines (TAA) as electron donors and three triarylboranes (TAB) as electron acceptors in a symmetric (1) and asymmetric (2) fashion as well as one model compound (3) with only one donor-acceptor pair were investigated by ultrafast transient absorption and fluorescence upconversion spectroscopy. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements revealed energy redistribution between localised, partly relaxed CT-states of the HABs 1 and 2 induced by dipole-dipole interaction with energy transfer time constants of ca. 3 ps. These results manifest symmetry breaking in the formally symmetric HAB 1 upon photoexcitation.

27031708|t|The Influence of Texting Language on Grammar and Executive Functions in Primary School Children.
27031708|a|When sending text messages on their mobile phone to friends, children often use a special type of register, which is called textese. This register allows the omission of words and the use of textisms: instances of non-standard written language such as 4ever (forever). Previous studies have shown that textese has a positive effect on children's literacy abilities. In addition, it is possible that children's grammar system is affected by textese as well, as grammar rules are often transgressed in this register. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to investigate whether the use of textese influences children's grammar performance, and whether this effect is specific to grammar or language in general. Additionally, studies have not yet investigated the influence of textese on children's cognitive abilities. Consequently, the secondary aim of this study was to find out whether textese affects children's executive functions. To investigate this, 55 children between 10 and 13 years old were tested on a receptive vocabulary and grammar performance (sentence repetition) task and various tasks measuring executive functioning. In addition, text messages were elicited and the number of omissions and textisms in children's messages were calculated. Regression analyses showed that omissions were a significant predictor of children's grammar performance after various other variables were controlled for: the more words children omitted in their text messages, the better their performance on the grammar task. Although textisms correlated (marginally) significantly with vocabulary, grammar and selective attention scores and omissions marginally significantly with vocabulary scores, no other significant effects were obtained for measures of textese in the regression analyses: neither for the language outcomes, nor for the executive function tasks. Hence, our results show that textese is positively related to children's grammar performance. On the other hand, use of textese does not affect-positively nor negatively-children's executive functions.

27149380|t|A Regional Reduction in Ito and IKACh in the Murine Posterior Left Atrial Myocardium Is Associated with Action Potential Prolongation and Increased Ectopic Activity.
27149380|a|BACKGROUND: The left atrial posterior wall (LAPW) is potentially an important area for the development and maintenance of atrial fibrillation. We assessed whether there are regional electrical differences throughout the murine left atrial myocardium that could underlie regional differences in arrhythmia susceptibility. METHODS: We used high-resolution optical mapping and sharp microelectrode recordings to quantify regional differences in electrical activation and repolarisation within the intact, superfused murine left atrium and quantified regional ion channel mRNA expression by Taqman Low Density Array. We also performed selected cellular electrophysiology experiments to validate regional differences in ion channel function. RESULTS: Spontaneous ectopic activity was observed during sustained 1Hz pacing in 10/19 intact LA and this was abolished following resection of LAPW (0/19 resected LA, P<0.001). The source of the ectopic activity was the LAPW myocardium, distinct from the pulmonary vein sleeve and LAA, determined by optical mapping. Overall, LAPW action potentials (APs) were ca. 40% longer than the LAA and this region displayed more APD heterogeneity. mRNA expression of Kcna4, Kcnj3 and Kcnj5 was lower in the LAPW myocardium than in the LAA. Cardiomyocytes isolated from the LAPW had decreased Ito and a reduced IKACh current density at both positive and negative test potentials. CONCLUSIONS: The murine LAPW myocardium has a different electrical phenotype and ion channel mRNA expression profile compared with other regions of the LA, and this is associated with increased ectopic activity. If similar regional electrical differences are present in the human LA, then the LAPW may be a potential future target for treatment of atrial fibrillation.

27148837|t|The mechanism of the dielectric relaxation in water.
27148837|a|UNASSIGNED: Although relating to the same system, the interpretations of the water spectra from Raman and Dielectric spectroscopy present independent pictures of the nature of water. We show that in the overlap region of the two methods it is possible to combine these views into a coherent concept of what drives the dynamic features of water. In this work, we develop the idea that the dielectric relaxation in water is driven by the migration of defects through the H-bond network, leading to a Debye-like peak in the lower frequencies. The deviation from the Debye law in the higher sub-THz frequencies is traced to a global fluctuation of the same H-bond network, clearly evident in the Raman Spectra. By incorporating these two views, a mathematical formalism is presented that can aptly explicate the dielectric spectra of liquid water.

27149682|t|Improved Superconducting properties in the Mg(11)B2 low activation superconductor prepared by low-temperature sintering.
27149682|a|UNASSIGNED: Mg(11)B2 has a great application prospect in the superconducting coils for fusion reactor as the "low activation superconductors". The un-doped Mg(11)B2 and Cu-doped Mg(11)B2 bulks using (11)B as a boron precursor were fabricated by low-temperature sintering in present work. It was found that the prepared Mg(11)B2 low activation superconductors exhibit better Jc performance than all of other Mg(11)B2 samples reported in previous studies. As for Cu doped Mg(11)B2, minor Cu addition can obviously improve the Mg(11)B2 grain crystallization and reduce the amount of MgO impurity. Hence, improved grain connectivity and higher Jc at low fields is obtained in Cu doped Mg(11)B2 samples. For un-doped samples, refined grains and more MgO impurity with proper size brought about more flux pinning centers, resulting in better Jc performance at high fields.

27147545|t|Comparison of pathogenicity prediction tools on missense variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S associated with malignant hyperthermia.
27147545|a|BACKGROUND: Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic disorder that has been linked to the skeletal muscle calcium release channel (RYR1) and the a1S subunit of the voltage-dependent L-type calcium channel (CACNA1S). Genomic DNA capture and next generation sequencing are becoming the preferred method to identify mutations in these genes. Bioinformatic pathogenicity prediction of identified variants may help to determine if these variants are in fact disease causing. METHODS: Eight pathogenicity prediction programmes freely available on the web were used to determine their ability to correctly predict the impact of a missense variant on RyR1 or dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) protein function. We tested MH-causative variants, variants that had been shown to alter calcium release in cells, and common sequence variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S. RESULTS: None of the prediction programmes was able to identify all of the variants tested correctly as either 'damaging' (MH-causative variants, variants that had been shown to alter calcium release in cells) or as 'benign' (common sequence variants). The overall sensitivity of predictions ranged from 84% to 100% depending on the programme used, with specificity from 25% to 83%. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we determined the sensitivity and specificity of bioinformatic pathogenicity prediction tools for RYR1 and CACNA1S. We suggest that the prediction results should be treated with caution, as none of the programmes tested predicted all the variants correctly and should only be used in combination with other available data (functional assays, segregation analysis).

27101409|t|Enhanced Zone II Flexor Tendon Repair through a New Half Hitch Loop Suture Configuration.
27101409|a|This study evaluated the impact of a new half hitch loop suture configuration on flexor tendon repair mechanics. Cadaver canine flexor digitorum profundus tendons were repaired with 4- or 8-strands, 4-0 or 3-0 suture, with and without half hitch loops. An additional group underwent repair with half hitch loops but without the terminal knot. Half hitch loops improved the strength of 8-strand repairs by 21% when 4-0, and 33% when 3-0 suture was used, and caused a shift in failure mode from suture pullout to suture breakage. 8-strand repairs with half hitch loops but without a terminal knot produced equivalent mechanical properties to those without half hitch loops but with a terminal knot. 4-strand repairs were limited by the strength of the suture in all groups and, as a result, the presence of half hitch loops did not alter the mechanical properties. Overall, half hitch loops improved repair mechanics, allowing failure strength to reach the full capability of suture strength. Improving the mechanical properties of flexor tendon repair with half hitch loops has the potential to reduce the postoperative risk of gap formation and catastrophic rupture in the early postoperative period.

27101001|t|Homogeneous Canine Chest Phantom Construction: A Tool for Image Quality Optimization.
27101001|a|Digital radiographic imaging is increasing in veterinary practice. The use of radiation demands responsibility to maintain high image quality. Low doses are necessary because workers are requested to restrain the animal. Optimizing digital systems is necessary to avoid unnecessary exposure, causing the phenomenon known as dose creep. Homogeneous phantoms are widely used to optimize image quality and dose. We developed an automatic computational methodology to classify and quantify tissues (i.e., lung tissue, adipose tissue, muscle tissue, and bone) in canine chest computed tomography exams. The thickness of each tissue was converted to simulator materials (i.e., Lucite, aluminum, and air). Dogs were separated into groups of 20 animals each according to weight. Mean weights were 6.5    2.0 kg, 15.0    5.0 kg, 32.0    5.5 kg, and 50.0    12.0 kg, for the small, medium, large, and giant groups, respectively. The one-way analysis of variance revealed significant differences in all simulator material thicknesses (p < 0.05) quantified between groups. As a result, four phantoms were constructed for dorsoventral and lateral views. In conclusion, the present methodology allows the development of phantoms of the canine chest and possibly other body regions and/or animals. The proposed phantom is a practical tool that may be employed in future work to optimize veterinary X-ray procedures.

27101315|t|A magnetic resonance imaging-based classification system for indication of trans-sphenoidal hypophysectomy in canine pituitary-dependent hypercortisolism.
27101315|a|OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to establish a magnetic resonance imaging-based classification system for canine hyperadrenocorticism according to pituitary gland extension, determine indications for trans-sphenoidal hypophysectomy, and clarify the prognosis for each disease grade. METHODS: A 5-point classification system (Grades 1 to 5) was developed based on tumour extension in dorsal and cranio-caudal directions. Cases were then classified as Type A: no arterial circle of Willis or cavernous sinus involvement and Type B: cases in which these blood vessels were involved. RESULTS: Medical records and magnetic resonance imaging data of 37 cases with hyperadrenocorticism were reviewed. Thirty-three cases underwent surgery; 4 Grade 5 cases did not have appropriate indications for surgery, and other therapies were used. Complete resection was achieved for 3, 3, 22 and 1 Grade 1A, 2A, 3A and 3B cases, respectively. Resection was incomplete in 1, 1 and 2 Grade 3A, 3B and 4B cases, respectively. Remission was achieved in 29 cases. Recurrence occurred in 4 cases, all of which were classified as Grade 3. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Dogs with Type A, Grade 1 to 3 hyperadrenocorticism had a good prognosis following trans-sphenoidal hypophysectomy. Grade 3B, 4 and 5 cases may not be suitable for this surgery.

27099871|t|System Integration and Preliminary In-Vivo Experiments of a Robot for Ultrasound Guidance and Monitoring during Radiotherapy.
27099871|a|UNASSIGNED: We are developing a cooperatively-controlled robot system in which a clinician and robot share control of a 3D ultrasound (US) probe. The goals of the system are to provide guidance for patient setup and real-time target monitoring during fractionated radiotherapy. Currently, there is limited use of realtime US image feedback during radiotherapy for lower abdominal organs and it has not yet been clinically applied for upper abdominal organs. One challenge is that placing an US probe on the patient produces tissue deformation around the target organ, leading to displacement of the target. Our solution is to perform treatment planning on the deformed organ and then to reproduce this deformation during radiotherapy. We therefore introduce a robot system to hold the US probe on the patient. In order to create a consistent deformation, the system records the robot position, contact force, and reference US image during simulation and then introduces virtual constraints (soft virtual fixtures) to guide the clinician to correctly place the probe during the fractionated treatments. Because the robot is under-actuated (5 motorized and 6 passive degrees-of-freedom), the guidance also involves a graphical user interface (adjustment GUI) to achieve the desired probe orientation. This paper presents the integrated system, a proposed clinical workflow, the results of an initial in-vivo canine study with a 3-DOF robot, and the results of phantom experiments with an improved 5-DOF robotic system. The results suggest that the guidance may enable the clinician to more consistently and accurately place the US probe.

27037861|t|Gadolinium-decorated silica microspheres as redox-responsive MRI probes for applications in cell therapy follow-up.
27037861|a|UNASSIGNED: To bridge the knowledge gap between cell therapy administration and endpoint health outcomes there is a urgent need of non-invasive, clinically compliant methods enabling to follow-up longitudinally the viability of transplanted cells. We present a novel approach to follow-up therapeutic cells, based on microenvironment-responsive MRI contrast agents to probe the capacity of the microenvironment surrounding cells to support their survival. The MRI probe is based on porous silica microparticles functionalized with a Gd-HPDO3A chelate through a redox-responsive disulphide bond, and with rhodamine B to allow for optical fluorescence imaging. These imaging labelled silica particles have been designed with micrometer size and surface properties suitable to ensure a stable entrapment within a hydrogel matrix made of collagen/hyaluronic acid, and to minimize interactions with interspersed therapeutic cells. Responsivity to the redox potential is achieved by pharmacokinetic modulation: under reducing conditions (i.e. hypoxia), the reductive cleavage of the disulfide bond and the clearance of the released low molecular weight Gd-complex result into the decrease of T1 contrast enhancement. Such a change of MR image contrast can be interpreted in terms of cell survival.

27076731|t|Brain lesions in eclampsia: A series of 39 cases admitted in an Intensive Care Unit.
27076731|a|The aim of this study was to identify the encephalic lesions in the eclampsia occurrences. Within a period of 18 months, computed tomography (CT) of the brain was performed in all patients admitted in intensive care for eclampsia. These CTs were analyzed and intracerebral lesions were identified. Thirty-nine patients were included. We noted 10 cases of ischemic stroke, 9 cases of cerebral edema, and 3 cases of hemorrhagic stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The CT scan came back to normal in 20 eclamptic patients. Overall, delays in obstetric and intensive care and time of completion of the CT were long. CT has allowed highlighting in patients with eclampsia varied intracerebral lesions. The early performance of the CT is therefore essential for a better support of patients.

27060911|t|The Influence of Pre-natal Supplement Initiation on Preterm Birth Among Majority Hispanic Women in Los Angeles County: The Role of Nativity.
27060911|a|UNASSIGNED: Objectives Despite being encouraged to take pre-natal supplements, suboptimal micronutrient intake is common in pregnancy, especially among Hispanic women. In this study, we assessed whether initiation and timing of pre-natal vitamin use influences the risk of preterm birth. Methods Women who gave birth to singletons in 2003 in Los Angeles County, California, were enrolled into a population-based case-control study. Focusing on non-Hispanic white and Hispanic women, associations between timing of pre-natal supplement use and preterm birth were assessed using logistic regression. Results Among Hispanic mothers, the odds of preterm birth increased the later a woman initiated pre-natal supplement use in pregnancy. The magnitude of this association was larger in US-born compared to foreign-born Hispanic women. Conclusions These findings suggest that nativity may modify the relationship between pre-natal supplement use and preterm birth possibly due to underlying differences in diet composition of Hispanic women by place of birth.

27027614|t|Diffusion weighted imaging in gynecological malignancies - present and future.
27027614|a|The management of gynaecological malignancies has undergone a significant change in recent years with our improved understanding of cancer biogenetics, development of new treatment regimens and enhanced screening. Due to the rapid blooming of newer methods and techniques in gynaecology, surgery and oncology the scope and the role of imaging has also widened. Functional imaging in the form of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) has been recently found to be very useful in assessing various tumours. Its ability to identify changes in the molecular level has dramatically changed the diagnostic approach of radiologists which was solely based on morphological criteria. It can improve the diagnostic accuracy of conventional magnetic resonance imaging, lend a hand in assessing tumour response to treatment regimens and detect tumour recurrence with better spatial resolution, negative radiation and diagnostic accuracy compared to positron emission tomography scan. The ability to quantify the diffusion has also lead to potential prediction of tumour aggressiveness and grade which directly correlate with the patient prognosis and management. Hence, it has become imperative for a radiologist to understand the concepts of DWI and its present and evolving role. In this article we present a brief description of the basics of DWI followed by its role in evaluation of female gynaecological malignancies.

27049669|t|Small-Molecule Target Engagement in Cells.
27049669|a|UNASSIGNED: Monitoring how, when, and where small molecules engage their targets inside living cells is a critical step in chemical biology and pharmacological research, because it enables compound efficacy and confirmation of mode of action to be assessed. In this mini-review we summarize the currently available methodologies to detect and prove direct target engagement in cells and offer a critical view of their key advantages and disadvantages. As the interest of the field shifts toward discovery and validation of high-quality agents, we expect that efforts to develop and refine these types of methodologies will also intensify in the near future.

27044475|t|The Complexities of Sexual Consent Among College Students: A Conceptual and Empirical Review.
27044475|a|UNASSIGNED: Headlines publicize controversies about sexual assault among college students, and universities face pressure to revise their sexual consent policies. What can the social science literature contribute to this discussion? In this article, we briefly discuss reasons for the recent upsurge in attention to these issues, the prevalence of sexual assault among college students, and aspects of college life that increase the risk of sexual assault and complicate sexual consent. We then review the conceptual challenges of defining sexual consent and the empirical research on how young people navigate sexual consent in their daily lives, focusing primarily on studies of U.S. and Canadian students. Integrating these conceptual issues and research findings, we discuss implications for consent policies, and we present five principles that could be useful for thinking about consent. Finally, we discuss some of the limitations of the existing research and suggest directions for future research.

27065818|t|Untangling Cortico-Striatal Connectivity and Cross-Frequency Coupling in L-DOPA-Induced Dyskinesia.
27065818|a|We simultaneously recorded local field potentials (LFPs) in the primary motor cortex and sensorimotor striatum in awake, freely behaving, 6-OHDA lesioned hemi-parkinsonian rats in order to study the features directly related to pathological states such as parkinsonian state and levodopa-induced dyskinesia. We analyzed the spectral characteristics of the obtained signals and observed that during dyskinesia the most prominent feature was a relative power increase in the high gamma frequency range at around 80 Hz, while for the parkinsonian state it was in the beta frequency range. Here we show that during both pathological states effective connectivity in terms of Granger causality is bidirectional with an accent on the striatal influence on the cortex. In the case of dyskinesia, we also found a high increase in effective connectivity at 80 Hz. In order to further understand the 80-Hz phenomenon, we performed cross-frequency analysis and observed characteristic patterns in the case of dyskinesia but not in the case of the parkinsonian state or the control state. We noted a large decrease in the modulation of the amplitude at 80 Hz by the phase of low frequency oscillations (up to ~10 Hz) across both structures in the case of dyskinesia. This may suggest a lack of coupling between the low frequency activity of the recorded network and the group of neurons active at ~80 Hz.

27165303|t|Parental and staff perspectives of NICU research procedures.
27165303|a|BACKGROUND: There are limited data on parental perception of infant participation in minimal risk and minor increase above minimal risk research focusing on the NICU population. The study objective was to assess parental and NICU staff perceptions concerning minimal risk and minor increase above minimal risk in the NICU setting. METHODS: Parents of infants and NICU staff were presented with a combination of 4 infant scenarios and 5 hypothetical research procedures. These assessed participants' willingness to allow their infant to participate in research and their attitude towards obligation to assist future children. Linear and hierarchal linear models analyzed the association and interaction effects on the likelihood to consent to research procedures. RESULTS: Sixty parents and 30 NICU staff members were surveyed. Parents' acceptability for each of the five research procedures ranged from 31  % to 83  %. Parent gender, age, race/ethnicity, insurance, education and history of previous child in the NICU were not associated with the likelihood to consent to the research procedures. Acceptability for each of the five research procedures among NICU staff ranged from 19  % to 98  %. There were no significant differences between NICU staff's and parents' responses for 4 of 5 research procedures. A minority of parents and nurses (38.3  % and 40  % respectively), compared to a majority of physicians (66.7  %), agreed or strongly agreed that parents have a responsibility to involve their children in low risk medical research in order to help future children, even if this would not help their own child. Lower agreement with obligation to help future children (p   <   0.01) and higher education (p   =   0.01) were associated with a decreased likelihood to consent to research procedures. CONCLUSION: In our study population, common NICU-related research procedures were considered appropriate and acceptable to a diverse group of NICU parents representing a wide range of race/ethnic and socioeconomic strata. Current regulations guiding informed consent for minimal and minor increase over minimal risk research in the NICU environment appear ethically consistent with a diverse group of parents and providers.

27165869|t|Attitudes in 2013 to Monitoring Intracranial Pressure for Traumatic Intracerebral Haemorrhage.
27165869|a|INTRODUCTION: Recent research has been equivocal regarding the usefulness of intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring for traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). We aimed to investigate attitudes of clinicians from as wide an international audience as possible. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A SurveyMonkey   questionnaire was distributed to individuals, including members of the Society of British Neurological Surgeons, the European Brain Injury Consortium, the Euroacademia Multidisciplinaria Neurotraumatologica and the neurotrauma committee of the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies. RESULTS: Ninety-eight participants from at least 25 different countries completed the survey (86 surgeons). ICP was routinely monitored by 76 % and would be monitored by 5 % more if they had equipment. ICP monitoring was valued (0   =   not at all important, 10   =   critically important) as 10 by 21 % (median   =   8; Q1   =   7, Q3   =   9). Responders were aware of 16 trials that investigated the value of ICP monitoring in neurotrauma, including BEST TRIP (n   =   35), Rescue ICP (n   =   13) and DECRA (n   =   8). Other results are discussed. DISCUSSION: Despite equivocation in the literature, we found that ICP monitoring continues to be routinely performed and is highly valued. Interestingly, only 36 % of responders were aware of the BEST TRIP trial, which found no difference in outcome between patients with a head injury managed with or without ICP monitoring.

27081355|t|Socio-economic factors affecting the conservation of natural woodlands in Central Riyadh Area - Saudi Arabia.
27081355|a|This study aimed to identify some socioeconomic factors affecting local people in central Riyadh area for the utilization of wood and other energy sources in cooking and heating in order to develop some recommendations for conserving woodlands. The study results revealed that gas is the most common energy source used for cooking with a mean usage level of 2.79 (SD  =  0.58). On the other hand, wood ranked first for heating with the highest mean, usage level of 1.90 (SD  =  1.06). However, electricity and gas as sources of energy for heating ranked second and third with mean usage level of 1.81 and 0.80 respectively. The study revealed that local people with the university education were significantly making higher use of electricity for both cooking and heating and those with no formal education ranked the highest on wood use for both cooking and heating. In addition, those living in traditional houses significantly used more wood for cooking than those living in villas and apartments. Also, local people with high income levels significantly were using more electricity for heating than others. The study recommended conducting extension and environmental awareness raising programs to enhance local residents' adoption of wood substitutes, promoting employment opportunities for unemployed locals, and subsidizing prices of alternative energy sources.

27076622|t|A novel technique for hepatic vein reconstruction during hepatectomy.
27076622|a|Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for malignant liver tumours. Nevertheless, surgical approach to tumours located close to the confluence of the hepatic veins is a challenging issue. Trisectionectomies are considered the first curative option for treatment of these tumours. However, those procedures are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates primarily due to post-operative liver failure. Thus, maximal preservation of functional liver parenchyma should always be attempted. We describe the isolated resection of Segment 8 for the treatment of a tumour involving the right hepatic vein and in contact with the middle hepatic vein and retrohepatic vena cava with immediate reconstruction of the right hepatic vein with a vascular graft. This is the first time this type of reconstruction was performed, and it allowed to preserve all but one of the hepatic segments with normal venous outflow. This innovative technique is a fast and safe method to reconstruct hepatic veins.

27042949|t|Head and neck chondrosarcomas: Analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database.
27042949|a|BACKGROUND: Chondrosarcoma is a rare tumor of the head and neck. Because of the limited clinical data, no studies have conducted a thorough comparison between head and neck chondrosarcomas and those arising at other body sites. METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we compared 682 patients with chondrosarcomas of the head and neck with 4757 patients with non-head and neck chondrosarcomas, evaluating disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) based on tumor location, histology, grade, stage, and treatment. RESULTS: Head and neck chondrosarcomas displayed a lower grade (p < .001) and stage (p < .0001) compared with other chondrosarcomas. Overall, chondrosarcomas of the head and neck had significantly higher DSS and OS than non-head and neck chondrosarcomas (p < .001). CONCLUSION: Chondrosarcomas of the head and neck display a lower grade and stage compared with other chondrosarcomas. DSS and OS were significantly greater for chondrosarcomas of the head and neck.    2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck, 2016.

27026968|t|SURGICAL TREATMENT OF UNSTABLE PELVIC RING FRACTURE IN SKELETALLY IMMATURE PATIENTS.
27026968|a|OBJECTIVES: To present the outcomes from definitive surgical treatment for unstable fractures of the pelvic ring in children undergoing surgical reduction and stabilization. METHODS: We studied 10 patients with immature skeletons who suffered unstable fractures of the pelvic ring and were treated between March 2004 and January 2008. The study was retrospective, based on clinical and radiographic evaluations. RESULTS: The mean age at the time of the trauma was 8.8 years (2 to 13 years). Seven patients were female and three was male. There were eight cases of trauma caused by being run over, and one case each of a motorcycle accident and falling from a height. Five patients had other associated injuries such as fractures of the clavicle, femoral diaphysis, proximal humerus, lower leg bones, olecranon and bladder injury. All the patients evaluated showed an excellent clinical outcome. The pelvic asymmetry before surgery ranged from 0.7 to 2.9 cm (mean 1.45 cm), and dropped to values between 0.2 and 0.9 cm (mean 0.39 cm) after reduction. In no case was any change observed in pelvic asymmetry measured in the immediate postoperative period and at the end of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Pelvic ring fractures in skeletally immature patients are rare and surgical treatment is unusual. Several authors have questioned conservative treatment because of the complications encountered. Bone remodeling does not seem enough to cause an improvement in pelvic asymmetry, and this justifies the choice of surgical treatment for reduction and correction of pelvic ring deformities.

27021854|t|BIOACTIVE PROTEINS, PEPTIDES, AND AMINO ACIDS FROM MACROALGAE(1).
27021854|a|Macroalgae are a diverse group of marine organisms that have developed complex and unique metabolic pathways to ensure survival in highly competitive marine environments. As a result, these organisms have been targeted for mining of natural biologically active components. The exploration of marine organisms has revealed numerous bioactive compounds that are proteinaceous in nature. These include proteins, linear peptides, cyclic peptides and depsipeptides, peptide derivatives, amino acids, and amino acid-like components. Furthermore, some species of macroalgae have been shown to contain significant levels of protein. While some protein-derived bioactive peptides have been characterized from macroalgae, macroalgal proteins currently still represent good candidate raw materials for biofunctional peptide mining. This review will provide an overview of the important bioactive amino-acid-containing compounds that have been identified in macroalgae. Moreover, the potential of macroalgal proteins as substrates for the generation of biofunctional peptides for utilization as functional foods to provide specific health benefits will be discussed.

27087212|t|[Effects of health management programs on weight among overweight or obese adults].
27087212|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of weight-loss for overweight or obese population under the health management programs, and to provide evidence for the development of safe and effective weight-loss programs. METHODS: 738 participants who resided in Beijing longer than one year, under 22 to 55 years of age, with BMI>= 24 kg/m(2) and without organic diseases were voluntarily recruited, from September 1(st) to October 15(th) 2013. All the participants were randomly divided into general management group or under health management group, in which all the subjects received intervention measures for 6 months. Anthropometry and body composition were measured at baseline and 6 months for all the subjects. Weight-loss effect from the health management programs was evaluated through analyzing the changes on weight and body fat. RESULTS: 618 participants completed the follow-up process, including 321 in the general management group and 297 in the health management group. 6 months after the intervention process, values of weight and body fat rate in the two groups appeared both significantly lower than that at the baseline levels. Difference before and after the intervention program was statistically significant (P<0.001). However, the differences of those with reduction value as 2.19 kg or 2.19% among health management group were higher than that in the general management group, which were 0.97 kg and 1.28% respectively, with difference statistically significant (P<0.001). The effective rate of 24.2% loss-weight and the 52.5% losing rate on body fat among the health management group were both higher than 11.8% and 34.3%, seen in the general management group, respectively, with difference statistically significant (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: The healthy management programs could effectively control the weight and body fate rate among the overweight or obese adults.

27166679|t|Codon-Driven Translational Efficiency Is Stable across Diverse Mammalian Cell States.
27166679|a|UNASSIGNED: Whether codon usage fine-tunes mRNA translation in mammals remains controversial, with recent papers suggesting that production of proteins in specific Gene Ontological (GO) pathways can be regulated by actively modifying the codon and anticodon pools in different cellular conditions. In this work, we compared the sequence content of genes in specific GO categories with the exonic genome background. Although a substantial fraction of variability in codon usage could be explained by random sampling, almost half of GO sets showed more variability in codon usage than expected by chance. Nevertheless, by quantifying translational efficiency in healthy and cancerous tissues in human and mouse, we demonstrated that a given tRNA pool can equally well translate many different sets of mRNAs, irrespective of their cell-type specificity. This disconnect between variations in codon usage and the stability of translational efficiency is best explained by differences in GC content between gene sets. GC variation across the mammalian genome is most likely a result of the interplay between genome repair and gene duplication mechanisms, rather than selective pressures caused by codon-driven translational rates. Consequently, codon usage differences in mammalian transcriptomes are most easily explained by well-understood mutational biases acting on the underlying genome.

27165321|t|A Bacillus megaterium System for the Production of Recombinant Proteins and Protein Complexes.
27165321|a|For many years the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus megaterium has been used for the production and secretion of recombinant proteins. For this purpose it was systematically optimized. Plasmids with different inducible promoter systems, with different compatible origins, with small tags for protein purification and with various specific signals for protein secretion were combined with genetically improved host strains. Finally, the development of appropriate cultivation conditions for the production strains established this organism as a bacterial cell factory even for large proteins. Along with the overproduction of individual proteins the organism is now also used for the simultaneous coproduction of up to 14 recombinant proteins, multiple subsequently interacting or forming protein complexes. Some of these recombinant strains are successfully used for bioconversion or the biosynthesis of valuable components including vitamins. The titers in the g per liter scale for the intra- and extracellular recombinant protein production prove the high potential of B. megaterium for industrial applications. It is currently further enhanced for the production of recombinant proteins and multi-subunit protein complexes using directed genetic engineering approaches based on transcriptome, proteome, metabolome and fluxome data.

27097227|a|UNASSIGNED: This study examined the impact of competition on the sleep/wake behaviour of elite athletes. The sleep/wake behaviour of Australian Rules Football players was assessed with wrist activity monitors on the night immediately before, and the night immediately after, a day game and an evening game. The time of day that a game occurred had a marked influence on sleep/wake behaviour later that night. After the evening game, sleep onset was later, time in bed was shorter and total sleep obtained was less than after the day game. It is yet to be determined whether a reduction in sleep after evening games impairs recovery.

27091989|t|Energy landscapes of a mechanical prion and their implications for the molecular mechanism of long-term memory.
27091989|a|UNASSIGNED: Aplysia cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding (CPEB) protein, a translational regulator that recruits mRNAs and facilitates translation, has been shown to be a key component in the formation of long-term memory. Experimental data show that CPEB exists in at least a low-molecular weight coiled-coil oligomeric form and an amyloid fiber form involving the Q-rich domain (CPEB-Q). Using a coarse-grained energy landscape model, we predict the structures of the low-molecular weight oligomeric form and the dynamics of their transitions to the b-form. Up to the decamer, the oligomeric structures are predicted to be coiled coils. Free energy profiles confirm that the coiled coil is the most stable form for dimers and trimers. The structural transition from a to b is shown to be concentration dependent, with the transition barrier decreasing with increased concentration. We observe that a mechanical pulling force can facilitate the a-helix to b-sheet (a-to-b) transition by lowering the free energy barrier between the two forms. Interactome analysis of the CPEB protein suggests that its interactions with the cytoskeleton could provide the necessary mechanical force. We propose that, by exerting mechanical forces on CPEB oligomers, an active cytoskeleton can facilitate fiber formation. This mechanical catalysis makes possible a positive feedback loop that would help localize the formation of CPEB fibers to active synapse areas and mark those synapses for forming a long-term memory after the prion form is established. The functional role of the CPEB helical oligomers in this mechanism carries with it implications for targeting such species in neurodegenerative diseases.

27101019|t|Cell layer-electrospun mesh composites for coronary artery bypass grafts.
27101019|a|UNASSIGNED: The current work investigates the potential of cell layer-electrospun mesh constructs as coronary artery bypass grafts. These cell-mesh constructs were generated by first culturing a confluent layer of 10T   smooth muscle progenitor cells on a high strength electrospun mesh with uniaxially aligned fibers. Cell-laden mesh sheets were then wrapped around a cylindrical mandrel such that the mesh fibers were aligned circumferentially. The resulting multi-layered constructs were then cultured for 4 wks in media supplemented with TGF-b1 and ascorbic acid to support 10T   differentiation toward a smooth muscle cell-like fate as well as to support elastin and collagen production. The underlying hypothesis of this work was that extracellular matrix (ECM) deposited by the cell layers would act as an adhesive agent between the individual mesh layers, providing strength to the construct as well as a source for structural elasticity at low strains. In addition, the structural anisotropy of the mesh would inherently guide desired circumferential cell and ECM alignment. Results demonstrate that the cell-mesh constructs exhibited a J-shaped circumferential stress-strain response similar to that of native coronary artery, while also displaying acceptable tensile strength. Furthermore, associated 10T   cells and deposited collagen fibers showed a high degree of circumferential alignment. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

27002673|t|Assessing the Effectiveness of On-Farm and Abattoir Interventions in Reducing Pig Meat-Borne Salmonellosis within E.U. Member States.
27002673|a|As part of the evidence base for the development of national control plans for Salmonella spp. in pigs for E.U. Member States, a quantitative microbiological risk assessment was funded to support the scientific opinion required by the EC from the European Food Safety Authority. The main aim of the risk assessment was to assess the effectiveness of interventions implemented on-farm and at the abattoir in reducing human cases of pig meat-borne salmonellosis, and how the effects of these interventions may vary across E.U. Member States. Two case study Member States have been chosen to assess the effect of the interventions investigated. Reducing both breeding herd and slaughter pig prevalence were effective in achieving reductions in the number of expected human illnesses in both case study Member States. However, there is scarce evidence to suggest which specific on-farm interventions could achieve consistent reductions in either breeding herd or slaughter pig prevalence. Hypothetical reductions in feed contamination rates were important in reducing slaughter pig prevalence for the case study Member State where prevalence of infection was already low, but not for the high-prevalence case study. The most significant reductions were achieved by a 1- or 2-log decrease of Salmonella contamination of the carcass post-evisceration; a 1-log decrease in average contamination produced a 90% reduction in human illness. The intervention analyses suggest that abattoir intervention may be the most effective way to reduce human exposure to Salmonella spp. However, a combined farm/abattoir approach would likely have cumulative benefits. On-farm intervention is probably most effective at the breeding-herd level for high-prevalence Member States; once infection in the breeding herd has been reduced to a low enough level, then feed and biosecurity measures would become increasingly more effective.

27002477|t|The three dimensional microstructural network of elastin, collagen and cells in Achilles tendons.
27002477|a|UNASSIGNED: Similar to most biological tissues, the biomechanical and functional characteristics of the Achilles tendon are closely related to its composition and microstructure. It is commonly reported that type I collagen is the predominant component of tendons and is mainly responsible for the tissue's function. Although elastin has been found in varying proportions in other connective tissues, previous studies report that tendons contain very small quantities of elastin. However, the morphology of and the microstructural relationship among the elastic fibres, collagen and cells in tendon tissue have not been well examined. We hypothesize the elastic fibres, as another fibrillar component in the extracellular matrix, have a unique role in mechanical functions and microstructural arrangement in Achilles tendons. Using confocal and Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) imaging techniques, this study examined the 3-dimensional microstructure of the collagen, elastin and cells in the mid-portion of hydrated rabbit Achilles tendons. It has been shown that elastic fibres present a close connection with the tenocytes. The close relationship of the three components has been revealed as a distinct, integrated and complex microstructural network. Notably, a "spiral" structure within fibril bundles in Achilles tendons was observed in some samples in specialized regions. This study substantiates the hierarchical system of the spatial microstructure of tendon, including the mapping of collagen, elastin and tenocytes, with 3-dimensional confocal images.

27166854|t|Contextual care of the patient following weight-loss surgery: Relational views and maintenance activities of couples.
27166854|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Weight-loss surgery (WLS) is a popular means toward achieving weight loss. Numerous studies report on the psychological and physical benefits of the procedure. Patients who have supportive others often demonstrate improved outcomes as compared to those who may not have support. The present study examines relationship maintenance activities that may contribute to a couple's positive adjustment following WLS, along with relational views that may modify and evolve as patients continue to lose weight. METHOD: Eleven heterosexual couples in which the female had WLS participated in in-depth, semistructured interviews. A deductive method of analysis was used to categorize relationship maintenance activities; an inductive method was used to examine relational views. CONCLUSIONS: Six types of relationship maintenance activities proved beneficial following WLS: (1) openness, (2) assurances, (3) food/meals as shared tasks, (4) joint activities, (5) antisocial, and (6) affection. In describing their relational views, participants spoke to the increasing independence, confidence, and self-focus of those who had had WLS. A persistent fat identity was also reported. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The findings can provide advanced practice nurses and other clinicians additional insight into, and strategies to assist, couples who have experienced, or will experience, WLS within their relationship.

27143517|t|Effects of early cleavage patterns of human embryos on subsequent in  vitro development and implantation.
27143517|a|OBJECTIVE: To establish a noninvasive selection system of human embryos with a high implantation potential before transferring. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Independent IVF clinics. PATIENT(S): One hundred sixty-four patients, with 791 embryos fertilized, checked, and recorded. INTERVENTION(S): Embryos were divided into nine groups according to the number of cells they contained and the extent of their fragmentation during the first and second divisions. We examined the effects of the cell division pattern and division time of embryos on subsequent development in  vitro and in  vivo using a time-lapse incubator. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Rates of blastocyst formation, high-quality blastocyst formation, and pregnancy. RESULT(S): The rates of embryos developed into blastocysts and blastocysts in which both the inner cell mass and trophectoderm grades were scored B or higher (good-quality blastocysts) were high in groups that formed two cells during the first division and four cells during the second division, regardless of the presence or absence of fragmentation. In these groups the first and second division times (25.90 and 37.88  hours after culture, respectively) of embryos developed into good-quality blastocysts were significantly shorter than those of other embryos. Although embryo selection based on the first and second division times did not affect the pregnancy rates after transfer at day 2 or 3 of culture, it improved the pregnancy rates after blastocyst transfer at day  5. CONCLUSION(S): Transfer of blastocysts derived from embryos that completed first and second divisions within 25.90 and 37.88  hours after culture, respectively, brings about high pregnancy rates.

27157542|t|Methyltransferase and demethylase profiling studies during brown adipocyte differentiation.
27157542|a|UNASSIGNED: Although brown adipose tissue is important with regard to energy balance, the molecular mechanism of brown adipocyte differentiation has not been extensively studied. Specifically, regulation factors at the level of protein modification are largely unknown. In this study, we examine the changes in the expression level of enzymes which are involved in protein lysine methylation during brown adipocyte differentiation. Several enzymes, in this case SUV420H2, PRDM9, MLL3 and JHDM1D, were found to be up-regulated. On the other hand, Set7/9 was significantly down-regulated. In the case of SUV420H2, the expression level increased sharply during brown adipocyte differentiation, whereas the expression of SUV420H2 was marginally enhanced during the white adipocyte differentiation. The knock-down of SUV420H2 caused the suppression of brown adipocyte differentiation compared to a scrambled control. These results suggest that SUV420H2, methyltransferase, is involved in brown adipocyte differentiation and that the methylation of protein lysine is important in brown adipocyte differentiation.

27050044|t|Minimal skin dose increase in longitudinal rotating biplanar linac-MR systems: examination of radiation energy and flattening filter design.
27050044|a|UNASSIGNED: The magnetic fields of linac-MR systems modify the path of contaminant electrons in photon beams, which alters patient entrance skin dose. Also, the increased SSD of linac-MR systems reduces the maximum achievable dose rate. To accurately quantify the changes in entrance skin dose, the authors use EGSnrc Monte Carlo calculations that incorporate 3D magnetic field of the Alberta 0.5 T longitudinal linac-MR system. The Varian 600C linac head geometry assembled on the MRI components is used in the BEAMnrc simulations for 6 MV and 10 MV beam models and skin doses are calculated at an average depth of 70  m using DOSXYZnrc. 3D modeling shows that magnetic fringe fields decay rapidly and are small at the linac head. SSDs between 100 and 120   cm result in skin-dose increases of between ~6%-19% and ~1%-9% for the 6 and 10 MV beams, respectively. For 6 MV, skin dose increases from ~10.5% to ~1.5% for field-size increases of 5      *      5   cm(2) to 20      *      20   cm(2). For 10 MV, skin dose increases by ~6% for a 5      *      5   cm(2) field, and decreases by ~1.5% for a 20      *      20   cm(2) field. Furthermore, the proposed reshaped flattening filter increases the dose rate from the current 355 MU min(-1) to 529 MU min(-1) (6 MV) or 604 MU min(-1) (10 MV), while the skin-dose increases by only an additional ~2.6% (all percent increases in skin dose are relative to D max). This study suggests that there is minimal increase in the entrance skin dose and minimal/no decrease in the dose rate of the Alberta longitudinal linac-MR system. The even lower skin dose increase at 10 MV offers further advantages in future designs of linac-MR prototypes.

27079138|t|Piloting social engagement on a federal agency-administered Facebook page.
27079138|a|OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of a Federal drug information center initiating engagement with stakeholders on a Facebook Page administered by a Federal Agency. SETTING: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Facebook page from July 21, 2014, to October 18,  2014. PRACTICE INNOVATION: FDA's Division of Drug Information (DDI) in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) Office of Communications serves as a federal drug information center providing timely, accurate, and useful information on CDER initiatives and CDER-regulated products. We report a 90-day (July 21 to October 18, 2014) pilot during which DDI pharmacists monitored and moderated comments received on FDA's Facebook page to  identify those warranting a reply. Once identified, DDI pharmacists replied within 2 business days. EVALUATION: Impact was measured by comparing the average number of Likes, Shares, and Reach for Facebook posts before and after the pilot. Additional metrics collected include the number of DDI replies provided to stakeholders' comments and the number of DDI replies provided on time (within 2 business days). RESULTS: During the pilot, DDI contributed 14 posts. On average, each post reached 23,582 more individuals (an increase of 187% compared with pre-pilot posts). On average, each post also received 463 more Likes (450% increase) and 130 more Shares (271% increase). DDI pharmacists replied to 3% (121/3,994) and hid 0.58% (23/3,994) of Facebook comments received during the 90-day period. All actions were taken within 2 business days. CONCLUSION: Initiating social engagement had a positive impact on FDA's Facebook page.

27025610|t|Cortactin and Exo70 mediated invasion of hepatoma carcinoma cells by MMP-9 secretion.
27025610|a|UNASSIGNED: This study was aimed to evaluate the regulation mechanism of cortactin (CTTN) on matrix metalloproteinases 9 (MMP-9) and its relations with Exo70 in invasion of hepatoma carcinoma (HCC) cells. The expression levels of CTTN, Exo70 and MMP-9 were detected in normal hepatocytes and various HCC cells by real-time PCR. Then the migration and invasion ability of these cells was revealed by scratch and invasion assay. The effects of CTTN on MMP-9 and the ability of migration and invasion were evaluated by silence and overexpress CTTN. During this process, the expression of CTTN was detected by Western blot, the activity and concentration of MMP-9 in supernatant of culture medium was detected by zymography and ELISA assay. Besides, Exo70 was also inhibited to reveal its effects on MMP-9 and the migration and invasion ability of LM3. Increased expression of CTTN, MMP-9, Exo70, reduced scratch area and increased puncture cell numbers were found in HCC cells (p  <  0.05). The expression of CTTN was significantly correlated with Exo70 and the migration and invasion ability of HCC (p  <  0.05). In addition, the activity and concentration of MMP-9 were significantly affected by the expression level of CTTN, while the expression of MMP-9 was not influenced. Besides, Exo70-si also exhibited significantly inhibition effects on the activity and concentration of MMP-9 and puncture cell numbers (p  <  0.05). A synergistic reaction may exhibited on CTTN and Exo70, which could mediate the secretion of MMPs thereby regulate tumor invasion.

27054089|t|First identification of Echinococcus multilocularis in rodent intermediate hosts in Sweden.
27054089|a|Echinococcus multilocularis is a zoonotic tapeworm with a sylvatic lifecycle and an expanding range in Europe. Monitoring efforts following its first identification in 2011 in Sweden have focused on the parasite's definitive host, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes). However, identifying rodent intermediate hosts is important to recognize opportunities for parasite transmission. During 2013-2015, livers from a total of 1566 rodents from four regions in Sweden were examined for E.  multilocularis metacestode lesions. Species identity of suspect parasite lesions was confirmed by PCR and sequencing. E.  multilocularis positive lesions >6  mm in diameter were also examined histologically. One Microtus agrestis out of 187 (0.5%, 95%CI: 0-2.9%), 8/439 (1.8%, 95%CI: 0.8-3.6%) Arvicola amphibius, 0/655 (0%, 95%CI: 0-0.6%) Myodes glareolus, and 0/285 (0%, 95%CI: 0-1.3%) Apodemus spp. contained E.  multilocularis metacestode lesions. Presence of protoscoleces was confirmed in the infected M.  agrestis and in three of eight infected A.  amphibius. Six of the nine positive rodents were captured from the same field. This is the first report of E.  multilocularis in intermediate hosts in Sweden. The cluster of positive rodents in one field shows that local parasite prevalence can be high in Sweden despite overall low national prevalence in foxes (<0.1%). The presence of protoscoleces in infected M.  agrestis and A.  amphibius indicate these species can serve as competent intermediate hosts in Sweden. However, their relative importance for E.  multilocularis transmission in the Swedish environment is not yet possible to assess. In contrast, the negative findings in all M.  glareolus and Apodemus spp. suggest that these species are of no importance.

27083391|t|Adaptation and validation of the Spanish version of the Actinic Keratosis Quality of Life questionnaire.
27083391|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: While there are questionnaires for evaluating the effects of skin cancer on patient quality of life, there are no specific questionnaires available in Spanish for evaluating quality of life in patients with actinic keratosis. The aim of this study was to translate and culturally adapt the Actinic Keratosis Quality of Life (AKQoL) questionnaire into Spanish. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The original questionnaire was translated into Spanish following the guidelines for the cross-cultural adaptation of self-report measures. Several measures of general reliability and validity were calculated, including Cronbach a for internal consistency and the Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient and a Bland-Altman plot for test-retest reliability. To test concurrent validity, we used the Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the correlation between AKQoL and Skindex-29 scores. RESULTS: The final version of the questionnaire was administered to 621 patients with actinic keratosis, who scored a mean (SD) of 5.25 (4.73) points (total possible score, 0-25). The Cronbach a reliability coefficient analysis was 0.84. The correlation between the mean (SD) score on the Skindex-29 (1.87 [4.07]) and on the AKQoL (1.97 [2.98] was 0.344 (P=.002, Spearman's rho), with a proportion of shared variance of 11.8%. CONCLUSIONS: The translation, cross-cultural adaptation, and validation of the original AKQoL produced a reliable, easily understandable questionnaire for evaluating the impact of actinic keratosis on the quality of life of patients in our setting.

27036951|t|Identification of Polycomb Group Protein EZH2-Mediated DNA Mismatch Repair Gene MSH2 in Human Uterine Fibroids.
27036951|a|UNASSIGNED: Uterine fibroids (UFs) are benign smooth muscle neoplasms affecting up to 70% of reproductive age women. Treatment of symptomatic UFs places a significant economic burden on the US health-care system. Several specific genetic abnormalities have been described as etiologic factors of UFs, suggesting that a low DNA damage repair capacity may be involved in the formation of UF. In this study, we used human fibroid and adjacent myometrial tissues, as well as an in vitro cell culture model, to evaluate the expression ofMutS homolog 2(MSH2), which encodes a protein belongs to the mismatch repair system. In addition, we deciphered the mechanism by which polycomb repressive complex 2 protein, EZH2, deregulatesMSH2in UFs. The RNA expression analysis demonstrated the deregulation ofMSH2expression in UF tissues in comparison to its adjacent myometrium. Notably, protein levels ofMSH2were upregulated in 90% of fibroid tissues (9 of 10) as compared to matched adjacent myometrial tissues. Human fibroid primary cells treated with 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), chemical inhibitor of EZH2, exhibited a significant increase inMSH2expression (P< .05). Overexpression ofEZH2using an adenoviral vector approach significantly downregulated the expression ofMSH2(P< .05). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that enrichment of H3K27me3 in promoter regions ofMSH2was significantly decreased in DZNep-treated fibroid cells as compared to vehicle control. These data suggest that EZH2-H3K27me3 regulatory mechanism dynamically changes the expression levels of DNA mismatch repair geneMSH2,through epigenetic mark H3K27me3. MSH2 may be considered as a marker for early detection of UFs.

27001389|a|UNASSIGNED: Our article reports a case of a 35-year-old man with cardiac mass, who underwent a wide range of imaging methods, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Contrast-enhanced MRI images revealed "sun ray" pattern in the mass. Final histopathological diagnosis of angiosarcoma was confirmed during autopsy. To our knowledge, our case is the second direct observation of this MRI diagnostic pattern and the first one that allows a comparison with PET/CT findings.

27005956|t|Preventing (impulsive) errors: Electrophysiological evidence for online inhibitory control over incorrect responses.
27005956|a|UNASSIGNED: In a rich environment, with multiple action affordances, selective action inhibition is critical in preventing the execution of inappropriate responses. Here, we studied the origin and the dynamics of incorrect response inhibition and how it can be modulated by task demands. We used EEG in a conflict task where the probability of compatible and incompatible trials was varied. This allowed us to modulate the strength of the prepotent response, and hence to increase the risk of errors, while keeping the probability of the two responses equal. The correct response activation and execution was not affected by compatibility or by probability. In contrast, incorrect response inhibition in the primary motor cortex ipsilateral to the correct response was more pronounced on incompatible trials, especially in the condition where most of the trials were compatible, indicating a modulation of inhibitory strength within the course of the action. Two prefrontal activities, one medial and one lateral, were also observed before the response, and their potential links with the observed inhibitory pattern observed are discussed.

27010279|t|SURGICAL IMPLANTATION OF COELOMIC RADIOTRANSMITTERS AND POSTOPERATIVE SURVIVAL OF CHINESE GIANT SALAMANDERS (ANDRIAS DAVIDIANUS) FOLLOWING REINTRODUCTION.
27010279|a|UNASSIGNED: Worldwide, there are only a handful of reintroduction programs for threatened salamander species, and very few have conducted postrelease studies to examine survival, habitat selection, and dispersal. Limitations in postrelease monitoring are primarily due to size constraints of amphibians and to dimensions of the radiotransmitters available for implantation. However, due to the large size of the critically endangered Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus), these animals make optimal candidates for surgical implantation of radiotransmitters prior to reintroduction or translocation. The objective of this study was to develop an anesthetic protocol using tricane methanesulfonate (MS-222) and test a surgical procedure for coelomic implantation of radiotransmitters for this species. A total of 32 Chinese giant salamanders from two age groups (Group A: 4.7 yr old, n = 16; Group B: 2.7 yr old, n = 16) were implanted with 4-g radiotransmitters designed for underwater monitoring of fish. Group A was held 16 wk before release while Group B was held 6 wk before release, and the salamanders' survival and postoperative complications recorded for the first month postrelease. Group A animals took longer to reach a surgical plane of anesthesia than did Group B animals, and this was directly correlated to mass of the animals. Postsurgery, one animal from Group B died of dehiscence before release while 83.9% animals survived after the first month in the wild. All of the animals that died postrelease were from Group B; three animals experienced dehiscence of the suture site and died while another two animals expired from trauma and fungal infection, respectively. Improvements for future studies include use of alternative suture material for closure after implantation and additional healing time of the incision.

27000956|t|Evidence for foliar endophytic nitrogen fixation in a widely distributed subalpine conifer.
27000956|a|UNASSIGNED: Coniferous forest nitrogen (N) budgets indicate unknown sources of N. A consistent association between limber pine (Pinus flexilis) and potential N2 -fixing acetic acid bacteria (AAB) indicates that native foliar endophytes may supply subalpine forests with N. To assess whether the P.  flexilis-AAB association is consistent across years, we re-sampled P.  flexilis twigs at Niwot Ridge, CO and characterized needle endophyte communities via 16S rRNA Illumina sequencing. To investigate whether endophytes have access to foliar N2 , we incubated twigs with (13) N2 -enriched air and imaged radioisotope distribution in needles, the first experiment of its kind using (13) N. We used the acetylene reduction assay to test for nitrogenase activity within P.  flexilis twigs four times from June to September. We found evidence for N2 fixation in P.  flexilis foliage. N2 diffused readily into needles and nitrogenase activity was positive across sampling dates. We estimate that this association could provide 6.8-13.6   g  N  m(-2)   d(-1) to P.  flexilis stands. AAB dominated the P.  flexilis needle endophyte community. We propose that foliar endophytes represent a low-cost, evolutionarily stable  N2 -fixing strategy for long-lived conifers. This novel source of biological N2 fixation has fundamental implications for understanding forest N budgets.

27008646|t|Surgical Non-governmental Organizations: Global Surgery's Unknown Nonprofit Sector.
27008646|a|BACKGROUND: Charitable organizations may play a significant role in the delivery of surgical care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, in order to quantify their collective contribution, to account for the care they provide in national surgical plans, and to maximize coordination between organizations, a comprehensive database of these groups is required. We aimed to create such a database using web-available data. METHODS: We searched for organizations that meet the United Nations Rule of Law definition of non-governmental organizations and provide surgery in LMICs. We termed these surgical non-governmental organizations (s-NGOs). We screened multiple sources including a listing of disaster relief organizations, medical volunteerism databases, charity commissions, and the results of a literature search. We performed a secondary review of each eligible organization's website to verify inclusion criteria and extracted data. RESULTS: We found 403 s-NGOs providing surgery in all 139 LMICs, with most (61  %) incorporating surgery into a broader spectrum of health services. Over 80  % of s-NGOs had an office in the USA, the UK, Canada, India, or Australia, and they most commonly provided surgery in India (87 s-NGOs), Haiti (71), Kenya (60), and Ethiopia (55). The most common specialties provided were general surgery (184), obstetrics and gynecology (140), and plastic surgery (116). CONCLUSIONS: This new catalog includes the largest number of s-NGOs to date, but this is likely to be incomplete. This list will be made publicly available to promote collaboration between s-NGOs, national health systems, and global health policymakers.

27123983|t|The MADD-3 LAMMER Kinase Interacts with a p38 MAP Kinase Pathway to Regulate the Display of the EVA-1 Guidance Receptor in Caenorhabditis elegans.
27123983|a|UNASSIGNED: The proper display of transmembrane receptors on the leading edge of migrating cells and cell extensions is essential for their response to guidance cues. We previously discovered that MADD-4, which is an ADAMTSL secreted by motor neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans, interacts with an UNC-40/EVA-1 co-receptor complex on muscles to attract plasma membrane extensions called muscle arms. In nematodes, the muscle arm termini harbor the post-synaptic elements of the neuromuscular junction. Through a forward genetic screen for mutants with disrupted muscle arm extension, we discovered that a LAMMER kinase, which we call MADD-3, is required for the proper display of the EVA-1 receptor on the muscle's plasma membrane. Without MADD-3, EVA-1 levels decrease concomitantly with a reduction of the late-endosomal marker RAB-7. Through a genetic suppressor screen, we found that the levels of EVA-1 and RAB-7 can be restored in madd-3 mutants by eliminating the function of a p38 MAP kinase pathway. We also found that EVA-1 and RAB-7 will accumulate in madd-3 mutants upon disrupting CUP-5, which is a mucolipin ortholog required for proper lysosome function. Together, our data suggests that the MADD-3 LAMMER kinase antagonizes the p38-mediated endosomal trafficking of EVA-1 to the lysosome. In this way, MADD-3 ensures that sufficient levels of EVA-1 are present to guide muscle arm extension towards the source of the MADD-4 guidance cue.

27122451|a|OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to compare inflammatory cytokine levels in primary knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients and healthy controls. METHODS: A total of 32 knee OA patients and 14 healthy controls were enrolled. A multiplex immunoassay was utilized for 10 cytokines in plasma and synovial fluid. RESULTS: Plasma IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6 concentrations were significantly greater in knee OA patients than controls. Moreover, both plasma IL-4 and IL-6 were positively correlated with the radiographic severity of knee OA. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma IL-4 and IL-6 may serve as biomarkers reflecting the severity of OA.

27056731|t|Convergent and Discriminant Validity of the Five Factor Form and the Sliderbar Inventory.
27056731|a|UNASSIGNED: Existing measures of the five factor model (FFM) of personality are generally, if not exclusively, unipolar in their assessment of maladaptive variants of the FFM domains. However, two recently developed measures, the Five Factor Form (FFF) and the Sliderbar Inventory (SI), include items that assess for maladaptive variants at both poles of each item. This structure is unique among existing measures of personality and personality disorder, although there is a historical, infrequently used Stone Personality Trait Schema (SPTS) that had also included this item structure. To facilitate an exploration of their convergent and discriminant validity, the SI and SPTS items were reorganized into FFM scales. The convergent and discriminant validity of the FFF, SI-FFM, and SPTS-FFM scales was considered in a sample of 450 adults with current or a history of mental health treatment. The FFF, SI-FFM, and SPTS-FFM were also compared with respect to their relationship with FFM domains. Finally, the FFF items and SI-FFM scales were tested with respect to their relationship with measures of maladaptive variants of both high and low agreeableness and conscientiousness. The implications of the results are discussed with respect to the assessment of maladaptive personality functioning, and suggestions for future research are provided.

27037883|t|Determination of fluoroquinolone antibiotic residues in the plasma of Eurasian griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) in Spain.
27037883|a|UNASSIGNED: Due to the possible toxicological impact, the accumulation of pharmaceuticals in wildlife as a consequence of human practices is of growing concern. The consumption of carrion at feeding stations - the so-called 'vulture restaurants' - with no management of the veterinary drugs it contains may expose scavengers to pharmaceuticals. To demonstrate this, we analyzed plasma from Eurasian griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) originating from two different areas of Spain for antibiotics such as enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, its primary metabolite. Quinolone residues were detected in about 65% (n=106) of birds, of which 15.1% (16/106) had quantifiable amounts of enrofloxacin (0.049  0.102 g/mL) and 5.7% (6/106) of ciprofloxacin (0.009  0.007 g/mL). The differences in exposure between the two sampled areas are attributable to different types of carrion management: the vultures that fed in areas with a high density of dead livestock (supplied directly to feeding stations) were more prone to exposure than those that sought food in areas where carcass availability is more unpredictable. Our findings are evidence that vultures have access to medicated livestock and that there are quantifiable levels of livestock antibiotics in vulture plasma. However, the vultures analyzed in this study had maximum antibiotic concentrations of only 0.4 g/mL, much less than the concentrations used in the clinical treatment of scavengers and a level that is probably too small to cause intoxication.

27009454|t|Local Ablation for Solid Tumor Liver Metastases: Techniques and Treatment Efficacy.
27009454|a|BACKGROUND: Treatment options for liver metastases from solid tumors, such as colon cancer, breast cancer, neuroendocrine tumors, and sarcomas, have expanded in recent years and now include nonresection methods. METHODS: The literature focused on the treatment of liver metastases was reviewed for technique, perioperative, and long-term outcomes specifically related to local ablation techniques for liver metastases. RESULTS: Ablation modalities have become popular as therapies for patients who are not appropriate candidates for surgical resection. Use of these techniques, alone or in combination with other liver-directed therapies (and often systemic therapy), has extended the rate of survival for patients with liver metastases and, at times, offers nearly equivalent disease-free survival rates to surgical resection. CONCLUSIONS: Although surgical resection remains the optimal treatment for liver metastasis, local options, including microwave ablation and radiofrequency ablation, can offer similar long-term local control in appropriately selected patients.

27012283|t|Photosynthetic contribution of the ear to grain filling in wheat: a comparison of different methodologies for evaluation.
27012283|a|UNASSIGNED: The culm (particularly the flag leaf) and the ear are believed to play a major role in providing assimilates for grain filling in wheat. However, the results obtained in the past varied depending on the methodology applied. Three different methodologies were compared that aimed to assess the relative contribution of the culm (photosynthetic organs below the ear) and the ear to grain filling. The first two consisted of applications of photosynthesis inhibition treatments, including the use of the herbicide DCMU and organ shading. The third was a non-intrusive method that compared the carbon isotope composition (  (13)C) of mature kernels with the   (13)C of the water-soluble fraction of the peduncle, awns and glumes. Several advanced CIMMYT lines were tested under good agronomic conditions. The   (13)C approach assigned a higher photosynthetic contribution to the ear than to the culm. However, some methodological considerations should be taken into account when applying the   (13)C approach, particularly the sampling method used, in order to prevent post-harvest respiration. The shading approach assigned a similar contribution to the ear as to the culm. The DCMU approach assigned a greater role to the culm but herbicide application to the culm affected the ear, thus biasing the final grain weight. Moreover DCMU and shading approaches may cause compensatory effects which overestimated the contribution of unaffected organs. This study may help to develop precise phenotyping tools to identify physiological traits such as ear photosynthesis that could contribute towards increasing grain yield.

27013805|t|In vitro Antimicrobial Activity of Traditional Plant Used in Mestizo Shamanism from the Peruvian Amazon in Case of Infectious Diseases.
27013805|a|CONTEXT: Our survey was performed near Iquitos (Peruvian Amazon) and its surroundings and leads us to consider Mestizo ethnomedical practices. The plant species reported here are traditionally used for ailments related to microbial infections. Inhabitants of various ethnic origins were interviewed, and 52 selected plants extracts were evaluated for their antimicrobial properties against a panel of 36 sensitive and multi-resistant bacteria or yeast. The study aimed at providing information on antimicrobial plant extract activities and the ethnomedical context of Mestizo riverine populations from Loreto (Peru). MATERIAL AND METHOD: The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the plant crude extracts were carried out using the agar dilution method and ranged between 0.075 and 5.0 mg/ml. RESULTS: Of the 40 plants analyzed, 9 species showed MIC  <=0.3 mg/ml (Anacardium occidentale, Couroupita guianensis, Croton lechleri, Davilla rugosa, Erythrina amazonica, Jacaranda copaia subsp. Spectabilis, Oenocarpus bataua, Peperomia macrostachya, and Phyllanthus urinaria) for one or several of the 36 microorganisms and only 6 drug extracts were inactive. Among the 40 plants, 13 were evaluated for the first time for an antibacterial activity. CONCLUSION: This evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of 40 plants using an approved standard methodology allowed comparing those activities against various microbes to establish antimicrobial spectra of standardized plant extracts, and give support to the traditional use of these plants. It may also help discovering new chemical classes of antimicrobial agents that could serve against multi-resistant bacteria. SUMMARY: This study leads us to consider Mestizo ethnomedical practices near Iquitos (Peruvian Amazon) and its surroundings. The plant species reported here are traditionally used for ailments related to microbial infections. 52 selected plants extracts were evaluated for their antimicrobial properties against a panel of 36 sensitive and multi resistant bacteria or yeast.

27012281|t|Age-associated circadian period changes in Arabidopsis leaves.
27012281|a|UNASSIGNED: As most organisms age, their appearance, physiology, and behaviour alters as part of a life history strategy that maximizes their fitness over their lifetime. The passage of time is measured by organisms and is used to modulate these age-related changes. Organisms have an endogenous time measurement system called the circadian clock. This endogenous clock regulates many physiological responses throughout the life history of organisms to enhance their fitness. However, little is known about the relation between ageing and the circadian clock in plants. Here, we investigate the association of leaf ageing with circadian rhythm changes to better understand the regulation of life-history strategy in Arabidopsis. The circadian periods of clock output genes were approximately 1h shorter in older leaves than younger leaves. The periods of the core clock genes were also consistently shorter in older leaves, indicating an effect of ageing on regulation of the circadian period. Shortening of the circadian period with leaf age occurred faster in plants grown under a long photoperiod compared with a short photoperiod. We screened for a regulatory gene that links ageing and the circadian clock among multiple clock gene mutants. Only mutants for the clock oscillatorTOC1did not show a shortened circadian period during leaf ageing, suggesting thatTOC1may link age to changes in the circadian clock period. Our findings suggest that age-related information is incorporated into the regulation of the circadian period and thatTOC1is necessary for this integrative process.

27014300|t|High Salinity Induces Different Oxidative Stress and Antioxidant Responses in Maize Seedlings Organs.
27014300|a|Salinity negatively affects plant growth and causes significant crop yield losses world-wide. Maize is an economically important cereal crop affected by high salinity. In this study, maize seedlings were subjected to 75 mM and 150 mM NaCl, to emulate high soil salinity. Roots, mature leaves (basal leaf-pair 1,2) and young leaves (distal leaf-pair 3,4) were harvested after 3 weeks of sowing. Roots showed the highest reduction in biomass, followed by mature and young leaves in the salt-stressed plants. Concomitant with the pattern of growth reduction, roots accumulated the highest levels of Na(+) followed by mature and young leaves. High salinity induced oxidative stress in the roots and mature leaves, but to a lesser extent in younger leaves. The younger leaves showed increased electrolyte leakage (EL), malondialdehyde (MDA), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentrations only at 150 mM NaCl. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and polyphenol content increased with the increase in salinity levels in roots and mature leaves, but showed no changes in the young leaves. Under salinity stress, reduced ascorbate (ASC) and glutathione (GSH) content increased in roots, while total tocopherol levels increased specifically in the shoot tissues. Similarly, redox changes estimated by the ratio of redox couples (ASC/total ascorbate and GSH/total glutathione) showed significant decreases in the roots. Activities of enzymatic antioxidants, catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6) and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR, EC 1.8.5.1), increased in all organs of salt-treated plants, while superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1), ascorbate peroxidase (APX, EC 1.11.1.11), glutathione-s-transferase (GST, EC 2.5.1.18) and glutathione reductase (GR, EC 1.6.4.2) increased specifically in the roots. Overall, these results suggest that Na(+) is retained and detoxified mainly in roots, and less stress impact is observed in mature and younger leaves. This study also indicates a possible role of ROS in the systemic signaling from roots to leaves, allowing leaves to activate their defense mechanisms for better protection against salt stress.

27168846|t|Assessment of vulnerable and unstable carotid atherosclerotic plaques on endarterectomy specimens.
27168846|a|UNASSIGNED: The types of lesion instability responsible for the majority of acute coronary events frequently include plaque disruption and plaque erosion with superimposed thrombosis. The term 'vulnerable plaque is used to describe atherosclerotic (ATS) plaques that are particularly prone to rupture and susceptible to thrombus formation, such as the thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA). The aim of the present study was to assess the morphological and histological differences between plaques that are unstable and those that are vulnerable to instability. Carotid artery endarterectomy specimens were obtained from 26 patients with carotid artery stenosis, consisting of 20 men and 6 women (age range, 35-80 years). Histological and morphometric methods were used to visualize and characterize the ATS plaques. Among the 26 carotid ATS plaques, 23% were stable, 23% were unstable and 54% were vulnerable. With regard to morphometric characteristics, the following mean values were obtained for the TCFA and unstable plaques, respectively: Fibrous cap thickness, 21.91 and 11.66   M; proportion of necrotic core area in the total plaque area, 25.90 and 22.03%; and the proportion of inflammatory area in the total plaque area, 8.41 and 3.04%. No plaque calcification was observed in any of them. Since ATS coronary artery disease is considerably widespread and fatal, it is crucial to further study ATS lesions to obtain an improved understanding of the nature of vulnerable and unstable plaques. The methods used to detect plaque size, necrotic core area and fibrous cap thickness are considered to be particularly useful for identifying vulnerable and unstable plaques.

27036889|t|Mosquito host choices on livestock amplifiers of Rift Valley fever virus in Kenya.
27036889|a|BACKGROUND: Animal hosts may vary in their attraction and acceptability as components of the host location process for assessing preference, and biting rates of vectors and risk of exposure to pathogens. However, these parameters remain poorly understood for mosquito vectors of the Rift Valley fever (RVF), an arboviral disease, and for a community of mosquitoes. METHODS: Using three known livestock amplifiers of RVF virus including sheep, goat and cattle as bait in enclosure traps, we investigated the host-feeding patterns for a community of mosquitoes in Naivasha, an endemic area of Rift Valley fever (RVF), in a longitudinal study for six months (June-November 2015). We estimated the incidence rate ratios (IRR) where mosquitoes chose cow over the other livestock hosts by comparing their attraction (total number collected) and engorgement rate (proportion freshly blood-fed) on these hosts. RESULTS: Overall, significant differences were observed in host preference parameters for attraction (F2,15   =   4.1314, P   =   0.037) and engorgement (F2,15   =   6.24, P   =   0.01) with cow consistently attracting about 3-fold as many mosquitoes as those engorged on sheep (attraction: IRR   =   2.9, 95 % CI 1.24-7.96; engorgement: IRR   =   3.2, 95 % CI   =   1.38-7.38) or goat (attraction: IRR   =   2.7, 95 % CI 1.18-7.16; engorgement: IRR   =   3.28, 95 % CI 1.47-7.53). However, there was no difference between the attraction elicited by sheep and goat (IRR   =   1.08; 95 % CI 0.35-3.33 or engorgement rate (IRR   =   0.96, 95 % CI      0.36-2.57). CONCLUSION: Despite the overall attractive pattern to feed preferentially on cows, the engorgement rate was clearly independent of the number attracted for certain mosquito species, notably among the flood water Aedes spp., largely incriminated previously as primary vectors of RVF. Our findings suggest that insecticide treated cattle (ITC) can be exploited in enclosure traps as contact bait in the monitoring and control of disease-causing mosquitoes in RVF endemic areas.

27086940|t|Process evaluation of a pilot evidence-based Polycystic Ovary Syndrome clinic in the Torres Strait.
27086940|a|OBJECTIVE: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a chronic endocrine syndrome in reproductive-aged women which is very common among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women. The objective of this study was to conduct a process evaluation of a pilot clinic on Thursday Island which aimed to provide a comprehensive evidence-based service for women with PCOS throughout the Torres Strait. DESIGN: Mixed-method evaluation at 12 months comprising a medical record audit, semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions. SETTING: Primary care. PARTICIPANTS: Audit of n = 11 clinics (n = 36 women), qualitative semi-structured interviews with n = 8 clinicians and focus group discussions with n = 8 women. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (i) Fidelity to evidence-based guidelines, (ii) barriers and enablers to women using the service, (iii) the ability to meet the needs of women and the community. RESULTS: The clinic was largely successful in providing evidence-based care with up to 78% of women receiving recommended cardiometabolic screening, 100% emotional screening and 89% lifestyle management despite the remoteness of the clinic and limited financial and human resources. Health care providers report sustainability of the clinic will be dependent on factors including staffing, administrative support and inclusion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health workers. CONCLUSION: While the clinic has been largely successful there are areas identified for potential improvement and to facilitate sustainability which should be considered before up-scaling this model to a national level. These include systems, administrative and staffing support, engaging with other community services to facilitate lifestyle changes and ongoing engagement and upskilling of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health care providers.

27037206|t|Thirty-day outcomes underestimate endocrine and exocrine insufficiency after pancreatic resection.
27037206|a|BACKGROUND: Long-term incidence of endocrine and exocrine insufficiency after pancreatectomy is poorly described. We analyze the long-term risks of pancreatic insufficiency after pancreatectomy. METHODS: Subjects who underwent pancreatectomy from 2002 to 2012 were identified from a prospective database (n  =  227). Subjects who underwent total pancreatectomy or pancreatitis surgery were excluded. New post-operative endocrine and exocrine insufficiency was defined as the need for new pharmacologic intervention within 1000 days from resection. RESULTS: 28 (16%) of 178 subjects without pre-existing endocrine insufficiency developed post-operative endocrine insufficiency: 7 (25%) did so within 30 days, 8 (29%) between 30 and 90 days, and 13 (46%) after 90 days. 94 (43%) of 214 subjects without pre-operative exocrine insufficiency developed exocrine insufficiency: 20 (21%) did so within 30 days, 29 (31%) between 30 and 90 days, and 45 (48%) after 90 days. Adjuvant radiation was associated with new endocrine insufficiency. On multivariate regression, pancreaticoduodenectomy and chemotherapy were associated with a greater risk of exocrine insufficiency. CONCLUSION: Reporting 30-day functional outcomes for pancreatic resection is insufficient, as nearly 45% of subjects who develop disease do so after 90 days. Reporting of at least 90-day outcomes may more reliably assess risk for post-operative endocrine and exocrine insufficiency.

27031942|t|Prototype Systems Containing Human Cytochrome P450 for High-Throughput Real-Time Detection of DNA Damage by Compounds That Form DNA-Reactive Metabolites.
27031942|a|UNASSIGNED: The formation of reactive metabolites through biotransformation is the suspected cause of many adverse drug reactions. Testing for the propensity of a drug to form reactive metabolites has increasingly become an integral part of lead-optimization strategy in drug discovery. DNA reactivity is one undesirable facet of a drug or its metabolites and can lead to increased risk of cancer and reproductive toxicity. Many drugs are metabolized by cytochromes P450 in the liver and other tissues, and these reactions can generate hard electrophiles. These hard electrophilic reactive metabolites may react with DNA and may be detected in standard in vitro genotoxicity assays; however, the majority of these assays fall short due to the use of animal-derived organ extracts that inadequately represent human metabolism. The current study describes the development of bacterial systems that efficiently detect DNA-damaging electrophilic reactive metabolites generated by human P450 biotransformation. These assays use a GFP reporter system that detects DNA damage through induction of the SOS response and a GFP reporter to control for cytotoxicity. Two human CYP1A2-competent prototypes presented here have appropriate characteristics for the detection of DNA-damaging reactive metabolites in a high-throughput manner. The advantages of this approach include a short assay time (120-180 min) with real-time measurement, sensitivity to small amounts of compound, and adaptability to a microplate format. These systems are suitable for high-throughput assays and can serve as prototypes for the development of future enhanced versions.

27018990|t|Practical Implications of the Non-Linear Relationship between the Test Positivity Rate and Malaria Incidence.
27018990|a|BACKGROUND: The test positivity rate (TPR), defined as the number of laboratory-confirmed malaria tests per 100 suspected cases examined, is widely used by malaria surveillance programs as one of several key indicators of temporal trends in malaria incidence. However, there have been few studies using empiric data to examine the quantitative nature of this relationship. METHODS: To characterize the relationship between the test positivity rate and the incidence of malaria, we fit regression models using the confirmed malaria case rate as the outcome of interest and TPR as the predictor of interest. We varied the relationship between the two by alternating linear and polynomial terms for TPR, and compared the goodness of fit of each model. RESULTS: A total of 7,668 encounters for malaria diagnostic testing were recorded over the study period within a catchment area of 25,617 persons. The semi-annual TPR ranged from 4.5% to 59% and the case rates ranged from 0.5 to 560 per 1,000 persons. The best fitting model was an exponential growth model (R2 = 0.80, AIC = 637). At low transmission levels (TPR<10%), the correlation between TPR and CMCR was poor, with large reductions in the TPR, for example from 10% to 1%, was associated with a minimal change in the CMCR (3.9 to 1.7 cases per 1,000 persons). At higher transmission levels, the exponential relationship made relatively small changes in TPR suggestive of sizeable change in estimated malaria incidence, suggesting that TPR remains a valuable surveillance indicator in such settings. CONCLUSIONS: The TPR and the confirmed malaria case rate have a non-linear relationship, which is likely to have important implications for malaria surveillance programs, especially at the extremes of transmission.

27051626|t|Formulation, characterization and evaluation of the effect of polymer concentration on the release behavior of insulin-loaded Eudragit(  )-entrapped mucoadhesive microspheres.
27051626|a|INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to use Eudragit(  ) RL 100 (pH-independent polymer) and magnesium stearate (a hydrophobic droplet stabilizer) in combination to improve the controlled release effect of insulin-loaded Eudragit(  ) entrapped microspheres prepared by the emulsification-coacervation technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mucoadhesive insulin-loaded microspheres containing magnesium stearate and varying proportions of Eudragit(  ) RL 100 were prepared by the emulsification-coacervation technique and evaluated for thermal properties, physicochemical performance, and in vitro dissolution in acidic and subsequently basic media. RESULTS: Stable, spherical, brownish, discrete, free-flowing and mucoadhesive insulin-loaded microspheres with size range of 14.20    0.30-19.80    0.60  m and loading efficiency of 74.55    1.05-75.90    1.94% were formed. After 3 h, microspheres prepared with insulin: Eudragit(  ) RL 100 ratios of 1:4, 1:6, and 1:8 released 73.40    1.38, 66.20    1.59, and 71.30    1.27 (%) of insulin, respectively. CONCLUSION: The physicochemical and physico-technical properties of the microspheres developed in this study demonstrated the effectiveness of the Eudragit(  ) RL entrapped mucoadhesive microspheres (prepared by the emulsification-coacervation technique using varying polymer concentration) as a carrier system for oral insulin delivery.

27023326|t|Acid Is Key to the Radical-Trapping Antioxidant Activity of Nitroxides.
27023326|a|UNASSIGNED: Persistent dialkylnitroxides (e.g., 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl, TEMPO) play a central role in the activity of hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS)-additives that inhibit the (photo)oxidative degradation of consumer and industrial products. The accepted mechanism of HALS comprises a catalytic cycle involving the rapid combination of a nitroxide with an alkyl radical to yield an alkoxyamine that subsequently reacts with a peroxyl radical to eventually re-form the nitroxide. Herein, we offer evidence in favor of an alternative reaction mechanism involving the acid-catalyzed reaction of a nitroxide with a peroxyl radical to yield an oxoammonium ion followed by electron transfer from an alkyl radical to the oxoammonium ion to re-form the nitroxide. In preliminary work, we showed that TEMPO reacts with peroxyl radicals at diffusion-controlled rates in the presence of acids. Now, we show that TEMPO can be regenerated from its oxoammonium ion by reaction with alkyl radicals. We have determined that this reaction, which has been proposed to be a key step in TEMPO-catalyzed synthetic transformations, occurs with k     1-3 * 10(10) M(-1) s(-1), thereby enabling it to compete with O2 for alkyl radicals. The addition of weak acids facilitates this reaction, whereas the addition of strong acids slows it by enabling back electron transfer. The chemistry is shown to occur in hydrocarbon autoxidations at elevated temperatures without added acid due to the in situ formation of carboxylic acids, accounting for the long-known catalytic radical-trapping antioxidant activity of TEMPO that prompted the development of HALS.

27156564|t|Finding safety: a pilot study of managed alcohol program participants' perceptions of housing and quality of life.
27156564|a|BACKGROUND: There is a higher prevalence of alcohol use and severe alcohol dependence among homeless populations. The combination of alcohol use and lack of housing contributes to increased vulnerability to the harms of substance use including stigma, injury, illness, and death. Managed alcohol programs (MAPs) administer prescribed doses of alcohol at regular intervals to people with severe and chronic alcohol dependence and homelessness. As a pilot for a larger national study of MAPs, we conducted an in-depth evaluation of one program in Ontario, Canada. In this paper, we report on housing and quality of life outcomes and experiences of the MAP participants  and staff. METHODS: We conducted a pilot study using mixed methods. The sample consisted of 38 people enrolled in or eligible for entry into a MAP who completed a structured quantitative survey that included measures related to their housing and quality of life. All of the participants self-identified as Indigenous. In addition, we conducted 11 in-depth qualitative interviews with seven MAP residents and four program staff and analyzed the interviews using constant comparative analysis. The qualitative analysis was informed by Rhodes' risk environment framework. RESULTS: When compared to controls, MAP participants were more likely to retain their housing and experienced increased safety and improved quality of life compared to life on the streets, in jails, shelters, or hospitals. They described the MAP as a safe place characterized by caring, respect, trust and a nonjudgmental approach with a sense of family and home as well as opportunities to reconnect with family members. CONCLUSIONS: The MAP was, as described by participants, a safer environment and a home with feelings of family and a sense of community  that countered stigma, loss, and dislocation  with potential for healing and recovery. The MAP environment characterized by caring, respect, trust, a sense of home, "feeling like family", and the opportunities for family and cultural  reconnections is consistent with First Nations principles for healing and recovery and principles of harm reduction.

27013928|t|Time course analysis based on gene expression profile and identification of target molecules for colorectal cancer.
27013928|a|BACKGROUND: The study aimed to investigate the expression changes of genes in colorectal cancer (CRC) and screen the potential molecular targets. METHODS: The GSE37178 of mRNA expression profile including the CRC samples extracted by surgical resection and the paired normal samples was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database. The genes whose expressions were changed at four different time points were screened and clustered using Mfuzz package. Then DAVID was used to perform the functional and pathway enrichment analysis for genes in different clusters. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed for genes in the clusters according to the STRING database. Furthermore, the related-transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) were obtained based on the resources in databases and then were combined with the PPI networks in each cluster to construct the integrated network containing genes, TFs and miRNAs. RESULTS: As a result, 314 genes were clustered into four groups. Genes in cluster 1 and cluster 2 showed a decreasing trend, while genes in cluster 3 and cluster 4 presented an increasing trend. Then 18 TFs (e.g., TCF4, MEF2C and FOS) and 18 miRNAs (e.g., miR-382, miR-217, miR-1184, miR-326 and miR-330-5p) were identified and three integrated networks for cluster 1, 3, and 4 were constructed. CONCLUSIONS: The results implied that expression of PITX2, VSNL1, TCF4, MEF2C and FOS are time-related and associated with CRC development, accompanied by several miRNAs including miR-382, miR-217, miR-21, miR-1184, miR-326 and miR-330-5p. All of them might be used as potential diagnostic or therapeutic target molecules for CRC.

27081468|t|Opium induces apoptosis in Jurkat cells via promotion of pro-apoptotic and inhibition of anti-apoptotic molecules.
27081468|a|OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the important molecules involved in apoptosis induction by opium in Jurkat cell line. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Jurkat cells were incubated 48 hrs with 2.86*10(-5) g/ml concentration of opium and apoptosis as well as expression levels of related molecules were measured. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that 50.3  0.2 percent of opium treated Jurkat cells were revealed apoptotic features. The levels of mRNA of several pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic molecules were increased and decreased, respectively, in the opium treated cells. The results also demonstrated that expression levels of BCL2, DFFA and NOL3 as anti-apoptotic molecules were increased in the opium treated cells. CONCLUSION: It seems that opium induces apoptosis in Jurkat cells via both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Although opium induces apoptosis in the cells but increased expression of some anti-apoptotic molecules may be a normal resistance of the cell for death.

27051871|t|Boundary lubrication of heterogeneous surfaces and the onset of cavitation in frictional contacts.
27051871|a|Surfaces can be slippery or sticky depending on surface chemistry and roughness. We demonstrate in atomistic simulations that regular and random slip patterns on a surface lead to pressure excursions within a lubricated contact that increase quadratically with decreasing contact separation. This is captured well by a simple hydrodynamic model including wall slip. We predict with this model that pressure changes for larger length scales and realistic frictional conditions can easily reach cavitation thresholds and significantly change the load-bearing capacity of a contact. Cavitation may therefore be the norm, not the exception, under boundary lubrication conditions.

27103332|t|The Health Care Strengthening Act: The next level of integrated care in Germany.
27103332|a|UNASSIGNED: The lack of integration of health-care sectors and specialist groups is widely accepted as a necessity to effectively address the most urgent challenges in modern health care systems. Germany follows a more decentralized approach that allows for many degrees of freedom. With its latest bill, the German government has introduced several measures to explicitly foster the integration of health-care services. This article presents the historic development of integrated care services and offers insights into the construction of integrated care programs in the German health-care system. The measures of integrated care within the Health Care Strengthening Act are presented and discussed in detail from the perspective of the provider, the payer, and the political arena. In addition, the effects of the new act are assessed using scenario technique based on an analysis of the effects of previously implemented health policy reforms. Germany now has a flourishing integrated care scene with many integrated care programs being able to contain costs and improve quality. Although it will be still a long journey for Germany to reach the coordination of care standards set by leading countries such as the United Kingdom, New Zealand or Switzerland, international health policy makers may deliberately and selectively adopt elements of the German approach such as the extensive freedom of contract, the strong patient-focus by allowing for very need-driven and regional solutions, or the substantial start-up funding allowing for more unproven and progressive endeavors to further improve their own health systems.

27168944|t|Avicenna's View on the Etiologies of Intestinal Obstruction.
27168944|a|CONTEXT: Bowel obstruction is one of the most common causes of acute abdomen. Because of heterogeneity of patients' population and variety of causes, therapeutic strategies are not standardized, so treatment of intestinal obstruction is a surgical challenge in many cases. A traditional medicine approach could help detect some issues that were ignored by modern medicine. One of the major schools of medicine, with a history of several thousand years, is Iranian traditional medicine. In this regard, Avicenna, who lived in the medieval period, has had a great influence on the medical knowledge of the world by writing an encyclopedia of medicine entitled "Qanun of Medicine." EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The aim of this study was to investigate Avicenna's views on the causes of intestinal obstruction and comparing them to modern medicine views. This is a review study on an Iranian traditional textbook of medicine by Avicenna, entitled "Qanun of Medicine" (in short "Qanun"). We used Qanun in its original language (Arabic) along with its Persian translation. It consists of 5 books. Part 16 of the third book talks about intestinal anatomy and introduces some intestinal diseases such as "qoolinj" and "ilavos." Intestinal obstruction can be a kind of "qoolinj" or "ilavos" disease. All intestinal obstruction etiologies in Qanun are searched in international and Iranian databases (Scopus, ISI, SID, and Iranmedex) and similar causes in modern medicine will be discussed in this article. RESULTS: According to Qanun, 16 causes are involved in intestinal etiologies of bowel obstruction such as "reeh," mucoid phlegm, abdominal hot and dry distemperament, decreased bile secretion, job, and so on while modern medicine considers some of them, for instance, volvulus, intestinal herniation, worm, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and opiate. CONCLUSIONS: Attention to the similar causes of intestinal obstruction in modern medicine and traditional medicine is the starting point for investigation of noninvasive diagnostic and therapeutic methods that have been mentioned in Qanun. In addition, etiologies which are missed in modern medicine can open new doors to the researchers and gastroenterologists for the study, diagnosis, and prevention of the disease.

27021691|t|Potential impact of land use change on ecosystem services in China.
27021691|a|Land use change can greatly alter spatial pattern and overall ecosystem service values (ESV). The goal of this study was to explore the likely effects of land use change on ESV in China. In this paper, the spatially explicit land use changes across China from 2010 to 2020 under the 2000s trend scenario and the planning scenario were projected using the Dyna-CLUE model. The ESV evaluation method was improved by adjusting the ESV coefficients using biomass data to reduce the generalization error of proxy-based method. The results revealed that between 2010 and 2020, total ESV increased by 1798 and 2215 billion RMB a(-1) under the 2000s trend scenario and the planning scenario, respectively. The spatial pattern of ESV in 2010 and 2020 presented a logical geographic distribution. The areas with ESV of 50,000 RMB  ha(-1)  a(-1) and higher occurred primarily in northeastern and southern China, while the areas with ESV of 5000 RMB  ha(-1)  a(-1) and lower were mainly located in northwestern China. The spatial differences between the two scenarios were insignificant except that the increase of ESV in southwestern China was more prominent in the planning scenario than that in the 2000s trend scenario, while the total ESV in 2020 under the planning scenario was larger than that in the 2000s trend scenario. The increase of ESV occurred mainly in northeastern, southern, and southeastern China due to forest growth and woodland expansion in 2020 compared with 2010. The results of this study can provide useful information for the public and land managers to consider.

27028847|t|Second-order capillary electrophoresis diode array detector data modeled with the Tucker3 algorithm. A novel strategy for Argentinean white wine discrimination respect to grape variety.
27028847|a|UNASSIGNED: Data obtained by capillary electrophoresis with diode array detection (CE-DAD) were modeled with the purpose to discriminate Argentinean white wines samples produced from three grape varieties (Torront  s, Chardonnay, and Sauvignon blanc). Thirty eight samples of commercial white wine from four wine-producing provinces of Argentina (Mendoza, San Juan, Salta, and Rio Negro) were analyzed. CE-DAD matrices with dimensions of 421 elution times (from 1.17 to 7.39 minutes) * 71 wavelengths (from 227 to 367 nm) were joined in a three way data array and decomposed by Tucker3 method under non-negativity constraint, employing 18, 18 and 6 factors in the modes 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Using the scores of Tucker model, it was possible to discriminate samples of Argentinean white wine by linear discriminant analysis and Kernel linear discriminant analysis. Core element analysis of the Tucker3 model allows identifying the loading profiles in spectral mode related to Argentinean white wine samples. This article is protected by copyright.

27026307|t|Real-Time 3D Image Guidance Using a Standard LINAC: Measured Motion, Accuracy, and Precision of the First Prospective Clinical Trial of Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring-Guided Gating for Prostate Cancer Radiation Therapy.
27026307|a|PURPOSE: Kilovoltage intrafraction monitoring (KIM) is a new real-time 3-dimensional image guidance method. Unlike previous real-time image guidance methods, KIM uses a standard linear accelerator without any additional equipment needed. The first prospective clinical trial of KIM is underway for prostate cancer radiation therapy. In this paper we report on the measured motion accuracy and precision using real-time KIM-guided gating. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Imaging and motion information from the first 200 fractions from 6 patient prostate cancer radiation therapy volumetric modulated arc therapy treatments were analyzed. A 3-mm/5-second action threshold was used to trigger a gating event where the beam is paused and the couch position adjusted to realign the prostate to the treatment isocenter. To quantify the in  vivo accuracy and precision, KIM was compared with simultaneously acquired kV/MV triangulation for 187 fractions. RESULTS: KIM was successfully used in 197 of 200 fractions. Gating events occurred in 29 fractions (14.5%). In these 29 fractions, the percentage of beam-on time, the prostate displacement was >3  mm from the isocenter position, reduced from 73% without KIM to 24% with KIM-guided gating. Displacements >5  mm were reduced from 16% without KIM to 0% with KIM. The KIM accuracy was measured at <0.3  mm in all 3 dimensions. The KIM precision was <0.6  mm in all 3 dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical implementation of real-time KIM image guidance combined with gating for prostate cancer eliminates large prostate displacements during treatment delivery. Both in  vivo KIM accuracy and precision are well below 1  mm.

27099614|t|Cytotoxicity and Antiproliferative Activity Assay of Clove Mistletoe (Dendrophthoe pentandra (L.) Miq.) Leaves Extracts.
27099614|a|Clove mistletoe (Dendrophthoe pentandra (L.) Miq.) is a semiparasitic plant that belongs to Loranthaceae family. Clove mistletoe was traditionally used for cancer treatment in Indonesia. In the present study, we examined cytotoxicity of clove mistletoe leaves extracts against brine shrimps and conducted their antiproliferative activity on K562 (human chronic myelogenous leukemia) and MCM-B2 (canine benign mixed mammary) cancer cell lines in vitro. The tested samples were water extract, ethanol extract, ethanol fraction, ethyl acetate fraction, and n-hexane fraction. Cytotoxicity was screened using Brine Shrimp Lethality Test (BSLT). Antiproliferative activity was conducted using Trypan Blue Dye Method and cells were counted using haemocytometer. The results showed that n-hexane fraction exhibited significant cytotoxicity with LC50 value of 55.31    g/mL. The n-hexane fraction was then considered for further examination. The n-hexane fraction of clove mistletoe could inhibit growth of K562 and MCM-B2 cancer cell lines in vitro. The inhibition activity of clove mistletoe n-hexane fraction at concentration of 125    g/mL on K562 cancer cell lines was 38.69%, while on MCM-B2 it was 41.5%. Therefore, it was suggested that clove mistletoe had potential natural anticancer activity.

27162057|t|Gradually softening hydrogels for modeling hepatic stellate cell behavior during fibrosis regression.
27162057|a|UNASSIGNED: The extracellular matrix (ECM) presents an evolving set of mechanical cues to resident cells. We developed methacrylated hyaluronic acid (MeHA) hydrogels containing both stable and hydrolytically degradable crosslinks to provide cells with a gradually softening (but not fully degradable) milieu, mimicking physiological events such as fibrosis regression. To demonstrate the utility of this cell culture system, we studied the phenotype of rat hepatic stellate cells, the major liver precursors of fibrogenic myofibroblasts, within this softening environment. Stellate cells that were mechanically primed on tissue culture plastic attained a myofibroblast phenotype, which persisted when seeded onto stiff (   20 kPa) hydrogels. However, mechanically primed stellate cells on stiff-to-soft (   20 to    3 kPa) hydrogels showed reversion of the myofibroblast phenotype over 14 days, with reductions in cell area, expression of the myofibroblast marker alpha-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA), and Yes-associated protein/Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (YAP/TAZ) nuclear localization when compared to stellate cells on stiff hydrogels. Cells on stiff-to-soft hydrogels did not fully revert, however. They displayed reduced expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and underwent abnormally rapid re-activation to myofibroblasts in response to re-stiffening of the hydrogels through introduction of additional crosslinks. These features are typical of stellate cells with an intermediate phenotype, reported to occur in vivo with fibrosis regression and re-injury. Together, these data suggest that mechanics play an important role in fibrosis regression and that integrating dynamic mechanical cues into model systems helps capture cell behaviors observed in vivo.

27040775|t|Reconstructing Carotenoid-Based and Structural Coloration in Fossil Skin.
27040775|a|UNASSIGNED: Evidence of original coloration in fossils provides insights into the visual communication strategies used by ancient animals and the functional evolution of coloration over time [1-7]. Hitherto, all reconstructions of the colors of reptile integument and the plumage of fossil birds and feathered dinosaurs have been of melanin-based coloration [1-6]. Extant animals also use other mechanisms for producing color [8], but these have not been identified in fossils. Here we report the first examples of carotenoid-based coloration in the fossil record, and of structural coloration in fossil integument. The fossil skin, from a  10 million-year-old colubrid snake from the Late Miocene Libros Lagerst  tte (Teruel, Spain) [9, 10], preserves dermal pigment cells (chromatophores)-xanthophores, iridophores, and melanophores-in calcium phosphate. Comparison with chromatophore abundance and position in extant reptiles [11-15] indicates that the fossil snake was pale-colored in ventral regions; dorsal and lateral regions were green with brown-black and yellow-green transverse blotches. Such coloration most likely functioned in substrate matching and intraspecific signaling. Skin replicated in authigenic minerals is not uncommon in exceptionally preserved fossils [16, 17], and dermal pigment cells generate coloration in numerous reptile, amphibian, and fish taxa today [18]. Our discovery thus represents a new means by which to reconstruct the original coloration of exceptionally preserved fossil vertebrates.

27045689|t|Effect of dystocia on subsequent reproductive performance and functional longevity in Holstein cows.
27045689|a|UNASSIGNED: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of dystocia on the reproductive performance and functional longevity in Iranian Holsteins. Data consisted of 1  467  064 lactation records of 581  421 Holstein cows from 3083 herds which were collected by the Animal Breeding Center of Iran from April 1987 to February 2014. Reproduction traits in this study included interval from first to second calving, days open and days from first calving to first service. The generalized linear model was used for the statistical analysis of reproductive traits. Survival analysis was performed using the Weibull proportional hazards models to analyse the impact of dystocia on functional longevity. The incidence of dystocia had an adverse effect on the reproductive performance of dairy cows. Therefore, reproductive traits deteriorated along with increase in dystocia score (p  <  0.05). The culling risk was increased along with increase in the score of dystocia (p  <  0.0001). The greatest culling risk was observed in primiparous cows, small herds and low-yielding cows (p  <  0.0001). Also, the lowest culling risk was found for cows calving at the youngest age (<27  months), and cows with age at first calving >33  months had the greatest risk (p  <  0.0001). The results of current study indicated that dystocia had important negative effects on the reproductive performance and functional longevity in dairy cows, and it should be avoided as much as possible to provide a good perspective in the scope of economic and animal welfare issues in dairy herds.

27003844|t|Impact of physical exercise on quality of life of older adults with depression or Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review.
27003844|a|INTRODUCTION: Physical exercise has been associated with improvement of quality of live (QoL), but its effect among the elderly with depression and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still unclear. This systematic review evaluated randomized and controlled studies about the effect of physical exercise on QoL of older individuals with a clinical diagnosis of depression and AD. METHODS: We searched PubMed, ISI, SciELO and Scopus from December 2011 to June 2013 using the following keywords: physical exercise, quality of life, elderly, depression, Alzheimer's disease. Only six studies met inclusion criteria: two examined patients with AD and four, patients with depression. RESULTS: The studies used different methods to prescribe exercise and evaluate QoL, but all had high quality methods. Findings of most studies with individuals with depression suggested that exercise training improved QoL, but studies with patients with AD had divergent results. CONCLUSIONS: Although different methods were used, results suggested that physical exercise is an effective non-pharmacological intervention to improve the QoL of elderly individuals with depression and AD. Future studies should investigate the effect of other factors, such as the use of specific scales for the elderly, controlled exercise prescriptions and type of control groups.

27001061|t|Uterine cervical neurotransmission and cervical remodeling.
27001061|a|UNASSIGNED: Cervical remodeling (CR) is a complex process, which, in part, is believed to be induced by physiological inflammation. Even though the female reproductive tissues are richly innervated by nerves from the parasympathetic pelvic autonomic ganglia, sensory dorsal root and nodose ganglia, their roles (neuronal factors) in this process (CR) has been largely attributed to sex steroid hormones, until recently. Here, we discuss the interaction between neuropeptides derived from peripheral nerves associated with uterine cervix and estrogen, and their likely impact on cervical remodeling. It is likely that these neuronal factors, under the influence of estrogen, could induce physiological inflammation during cervical remodeling by promoting the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, among other factors.

27003454|t|Effects of Jaw Clenching While Wearing a Customized Bite-Aligning Mouthpiece on Strength in Healthy Young Men.
27003454|a|Busc  , B, Morales, J, Solana-Tramunt, M, Mir  , A, and Garc  a, M. Effects of jaw clenching while wearing a customized bite-aligning mouthpiece on strength in healthy young men. J Strength Cond Res 30(4): 1102-1110, 2016-Recent studies have investigated the ergogenic effects of different types of mouthguards. There is evidence of the benefits of clenching customized mouthpieces on force and power development. The phenomenon called concurrent activation potentiation (CAP) promoted in jaw clenching seems to enhance the muscular strength and power in maximal isometric contractions and powerful actions in sport. Moreover, a bite-aligning mouthpiece may promote a more aligned and powerful clench. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of jaw clenching while wearing a customized bite-aligning mouthpiece (MP) on jump ability and isometric maximal strength tests in contrast to 2 other conditions: nonjaw clenching (NON-JAW) and jaw clenching without the mouthpiece (JAW). A within-subjects design was used to assess the jump performance and the maximal isometric force in 28 physically active male subjects. Statistical analyses revealed significantly higher performance in JAW and NON-JAW conditions for handgrip force (HG-peakforce) and all variables of the back-row exercise (BRW) and countermovement vertical jump (CMVJ) (p  <= 0.05). Significant differences between NON-JAW and JAW were found for HG-peakforce (p  <= 0.05). These findings suggest that it is advisable to use a customized bite-aligning mouthpiece to improve strength and power performance.

27000381|t|Carpal bones of Nacholapithecus kerioi, a Middle Miocene Hominoid From Northern Kenya.
27000381|a|OBJECTIVES: The carpal bones of the middle Miocene hominoid Nacholapithecus kerioi are described based on new materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The materials comprise a trapezoid, three capitates, two hamates, a centrale, a lunate, a triquetrum, and a pisiform, collected during the 2001 and 2002 field seasons from Nachola, Kenya. We also describe a pisiform recently assigned to the type specimen of N. kerioi, KNM-BG 35250. RESULTS: In the Nacholapithecus wrist, the ulnar styloid process articulates with both the triquetrum and pisiform, and the triquetrum facet on the hamate is relatively proximodistally oriented in dorsal view. The Nacholapithecus capitate possesses a moderate distopalmar hook-like process and separated radial articular facets for the trapezoid and the second metacarpal due to the carpometacarpal ligament attachment that is absent in the Proconsul capitate. DISCUSSION: The carpal anatomy of Nacholapithecus is similar to that of the early Miocene hominoid Proconsul. However, Nacholapithecus wrist anatomy appears to exhibit slightly more emphasized stability. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2016.    2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

27008458|t|The Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale: reliability and validity in Spanish patients with vestibular disorders.
27008458|a|PURPOSE: To examine the reliability and validity of the Spanish version of the Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale (ABC-S), and its ability to discriminate between patients with and without a history of falls among a Spanish population with vestibular disorders. METHOD: A total of 84 participants completed the ABC-S. Internal consistency, test-retest reliability and construct validity (exploratory factor analysis) were analysed. Concurrent validity was evaluated using the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) and the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI). To determine the accuracy of the ABC total score in discriminating patients with and without a history of falls, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed. RESULTS: The ABC-S showed excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's a   =   0.916) and substantial test-retest reliability (ICC   =   0.86, 95% CI: 0.74-0.93), with standard error and minimal detectable change values of 8.64 and 16.94, respectively. Factor analyses suggested a three-factor structure (explained variance was 62.24%). The ABC total score significantly correlated with the physical component summary score of the SF-12 and with the DHI-P, DHI-E, DHI-F and DHI total scores (p   <   0.001). The ABC-S was significantly able to discriminate between participants with and without a history of falls (p   <   0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The ABC-S is a valid and reliable instrument, suitable to assess balance confidence in Spanish patients with vestibular disorders. Implications for Rehabilitation The Spanish version of the ABC scale is a valid and reliable measure of balance confidence in patients with vestibular disorders. In persons with vestibular disorders, the Spanish version of the ABC scale has shown the ability to discriminate between patients with and without a history of falls in the last year.

27007545|t|Key role of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of infections around the hip and pelvic girdle mimicking septic arthritis of the hip in children.
27007545|a|UNASSIGNED: Infections around the hip and the pelvic girdle mimicking septic hip arthritis are rare conditions in the pediatric population requiring urgent treatment. They are not readily diagnosed because of rarity, resemblance to septic hip, and unclear pathophysiology, which often results in misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis, and delayed treatment. The aim of this study was to prove the key role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the first-line modality in making a early definite diagnosis of an uncommon perihip infection in children. We retrospectively reviewed 20 children with a provisional diagnosis of unilateral septic hip who were confirmed finally to have perihip infections and combined with concomitant osteomyeltis using MRI. All patients were treated with intravenous antibiotics with or without abscess aspiration until normalization of clinical symptoms and laboratory tests including serum C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. All infections healed successfully and the final C-reactive protein was recovered to a mean of 0.37   mg/dl (range 0.01-0.78   mg/dl) without recurrence or complication. Although the MRI is costly and limited in practical application, it was found to be effective as a primary diagnostic tool for an early, accurate diagnosis of infections around the hip and the pelvic girdle in children to correctly guide the decision and the approach for treatment.

27063218|t|Physcion 8-O-b-glucopyranoside induces mitochondria-dependent apoptosis of human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells via suppressing survivin expression.
27063218|a|AIM: A previous study has shown that physcion 8-O-b-glucopyranoside (PG) derived from Rumex japonicusHoutt causes apoptosis and blocks cell cycle progression in human lung cancer cells. In the present study we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying PG-induced cancer cell apoptosis. METHODS: Human OSCC-derived cell line KB was treated PG (10, 20, 50  g/mL). Cell apoptosis was detected with flow cytometry. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and release of cytochome C from mitochondria were measured; the expression of relevant signaling proteins was analyzed using Western blotting or qRT-PCR. For evaluation of in vivo anticancer action, nude mice grafted with KB cells were treated with PG (10, 20, 40 mg  kg(-1)  d(-1), ip) for 24 days. RESULTS: PG dose-dependently suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in KB cells. PG-induced apoptosis was mediated via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway, as evidenced by the decreased Bcl-2, increased Bax and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, as well as the loss of MMP, caspase-9 activation, and increased cytosolic cytochrome c. Furthermore, PG suppressed the expression of survivin, whereas overexpression of survivin markedly attenuated PG-induced apoptosis. Meanwhile PG increased the expression of tumor suppressor PTEN, and decreased p-Akt, p-GSK3b and miR-21 levels. Pharmacological activation of Akt/GSK3b signaling or transfection with miR-21 mimic abolished PG-induced survivin reduction and cell apoptosis. Similar results were observed in PG-treated nude mice grafted with KB cells. CONCLUSION: Physcion 8-O-b-glucopyranoside induces mitochondria-dependent apoptosis of human OSCC cells by suppressing survivin expression via miR-21/PTEN/Akt/GSK3b signaling pathway.

27098968|t|Two-Pore K+ Channel TREK-1 Regulates Sinoatrial Node Membrane Excitability.
27098968|a|BACKGROUND: Two-pore K(+) channels have emerged as potential targets to selectively regulate cardiac cell membrane excitability; however, lack of specific inhibitors and relevant animal models has impeded the effort to understand the role of 2-pore K(+) channels in the heart and their potential as a therapeutic target. The objective of this study was to determine the role of mechanosensitive 2-pore K(+) channel family member TREK-1 in control of cardiac excitability. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiac-specific TREK-1-deficient mice (aMHC-Kcnk(f/f)) were generated and found to have a prevalent sinoatrial phenotype characterized by bradycardia with frequent episodes of sinus pause following stress. Action potential measurements from isolated aMHC-Kcnk2(f/f) sinoatrial node cells demonstrated decreased background K(+) current and abnormal sinoatrial cell membrane excitability. To identify novel pathways for regulating TREK-1 activity and sinoatrial node excitability, mice expressing a truncated allele of the TREK-1-associated cytoskeletal protein bIV-spectrin (qv(4J) mice) were analyzed and found to display defects in cell electrophysiology as well as loss of normal TREK-1 membrane localization. Finally, the bIV-spectrin/TREK-1 complex was found to be downregulated in the right atrium from a canine model of sinoatrial node dysfunction and in human cardiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: These findings identify a TREK-1-dependent pathway essential for normal sinoatrial node cell excitability that serves as a potential target for selectively regulating sinoatrial node cell function.

27098709|t|Evaluation of immunomodulatory effect of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor on polymorphonuclear cell from dogs with cancer in vitro.
27098709|a|UNASSIGNED: The objective of this in vitro study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) on polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) function in dogs with cancer. PMNs were harvested from dogs with naturally developing cancer as a pre-clinical model to evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of rhGM-CSF on PMN phagocytic and cytotoxic functions, cytokine production and receptor expression. Some aspects of cancer-related PMN dysfunction in dogs with cancer were restored following incubation with rhGM-CSF including PMN phagocytosis, respiratory burst and LPS-induced TNF-a production. In addition, rhGM-CSF increased surface HLA-DR expression on the PMNs of dogs with cancer. These data suggests that dysfunction of innate immune response in dogs with cancer may be improved by rhGM-CSF. The results of this study provided a pathophysiologic rationale for the initiation of clinical trials to continue evaluating rhGM-CSF as an immunomodulatory therapy in dogs with cancer.

27098639|t|Ceramic brackets and low friction : A possible synergy in patients requiring multiple MRI scanning.
27098639|a|AIM: To investigate any advantages of low friction biomechanics in orthodontic patients with fixed appliances without producing metal artifacts during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Frictional resistance generated by bracket-wire-ligature systems was analyzed via an experimental model that reproduced upper canine misalignment. Each sample was tested 10 consecutive times in a dry state; a total of 160 tests were carried out. We documented the frictional forces generated by a 0.012- and 0.014-inch superelastic nickel-titanium wire (SENT) with ceramic self-ligating brackets (SLB) with metal insert and ceramic monocrystalline brackets with nonconventional elastic ligatures (NCEL) in conjunction with various degrees of canine misalignment (1.5, 3.0, 4.5, and 6.0  mm). Comparisons between the frictional forces released by the two different bracket-wire-ligature systems were made by conducting 3-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey HSD pairwise test (P  <  0.005). RESULTS: We observed no clinically relevant difference between the frictional forces released by ceramic SLB and ceramic brackets in conjunction with a 0.012- and 0.014-inch SENT. Statistically significant differences were apparent with a 0.012-inch SENT at 4.5 and 6.0  mm of canine misalignment, where the SLB revealed higher frictional forces. CONCLUSIONS: Ceramic brackets with NCEL revealed frictional forces similar to those generated in conjunction with ceramic SLB, thereby helping to avoid metal artifacts in case of expected necessary MRI during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances.

27098563|t|DNA methylation and targeted sequencing of methyltransferases family genes in canine acute myeloid leukaemia, modelling human myeloid leukaemia.
27098563|a|UNASSIGNED: Tumours shows aberrant DNA methylation patterns, being hypermethylated or hypomethylated compared with normal tissues. In human acute myeloid leukaemia (hAML) mutations in DNA methyltransferase (DNMT3A) are associated to a more aggressive tumour behaviour. As AML is lethal in dogs, we defined global DNA methylation content, and screened the C-terminal domain of DNMT3 family of genes for sequence variants in 39 canine acute myeloid leukaemia (cAML) cases. A heterogeneous pattern of DNA methylation was found among cAML samples, with subsets of cases being hypermethylated or hypomethylated compared with healthy controls; four recurrent single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were found in DNMT3L gene. Although SNVs were not directly correlated to whole genome DNA methylation levels, all hypomethylated cAML cases were homozygous for the deleterious mutation at p.Arg222Trp. This study contributes to understand genetic modifications of cAML, leading up to studies that will elucidate the role of methylome alterations in the pathogenesis of AML in dogs.

27098367|t|Marsupialization of a cyst of the nictitating membrane in three dogs.
27098367|a|BACKGROUND: Development of cysts has been reported as a potential complication after surgical repositioning of nictitating membrane gland protrusion using the conjunctival pocket technique. To the authors' knowledge, no treatment for these cysts has ever been published. OBJECTIVES: This short case series describes a surgical technique of marsupialization as a treatment option for these cysts and proposes a pathogenesis for cyst formation. CASES DESCRIPTION: Three dogs were each referred for a unilateral subconjunctival mass-like lesion involving the bulbar side of the nictitating membrane. Complete ophthalmologic examination revealed a pink, translucent, soft, and nonpainful mass protruding from the bulbar surface of the nictitating membrane in all cases. Treatment consisted in marsupialization of the cyst on the palpebral surface of the nictitating membrane and was curative with no short-term postoperative complication and favorable long-term outcome for the three dogs. Histopathological findings were consistent with a lacrimal cyst. CONCLUSION: Marsupialization appears to be a safe, simple, and effective treatment for nictitating membrane cyst secondary to surgical correction of gland prolapse using conjunctival pocket technique in dogs. Further studies on a larger number of cases are necessary to determine whether marsupialization is the technique of choice and to further investigate the pathophysiology of cyst formation after conjunctival pocket repositioning of prolapsed glands.

27008772|t|Using codispersion analysis to characterize spatial patterns in species co-occurrences.
27008772|a|Visualizing and quantifying spatial patterns of co-occurrence (i.e., of two or more species, or of species and underlying environmental variables) can suggest hypotheses about processes that structure species assemblages and their relevant spatial scales. Statistical models of spatial co-occurrence generally assume that underlying spatial processes are isotropic and stationary, but many ecologically realistic spatial processes are anisotropic and non-stationary. Here, we introduce codispersion analysis to ecologists and use it to detect and quantify anisotropic and nonstationary patterns and their relevant spatial scales in bivariate co-occurrence data. Simulated data illustrated that codispersion analysis can accurately characterize complex spatial patterns. Analysis of co-occurrence of common tree species growing in a 35-ha plot revealed both positive and negative codispersion between different species; positive codispersion values reflected positive correlation in species abundance (aggregation), whereas negative codispersion values reflected negative correlation in species abundance (segregation). Comparisons of observed patterns with those simulated using two different null models showed that the codispersion of most species pairs differed significantly from random expectation. We conclude that codispersion analysis can be a useful exploratory tool to guide ecologists interested in modeling spatial processes.

27031114|t|The Fifth Domain of Beta 2 Glycoprotein I Protects from Natural IgM Mediated Cardiac Ischaemia Reperfusion Injury.
27031114|a|Reperfusion after a period of ischemia results in reperfusion injury (IRI) which involves activation of the inflammatory cascade. In cardiac IRI, IgM natural antibodies (NAb) play a prominent role through binding to altered neoepitopes expressed on damaged cells. Beta 2 Glycoprotein I (b2GPI) is a plasma protein that binds to neoepitopes on damaged cells including anionic phospholipids through its highly conserved Domain V. Domain I of b2GPI binds circulating IgM NAbs and may provide a link between the innate immune system, IgM NAb binding and cardiac IRI. This study was undertaken to investigate the role of   2GPI and its Domain V in cardiac IRI using wild-type (WT), Rag-1 -/- and b2GPI deficient mice. Compared with control, treatment with Domain V prior to cardiac IRI prevented binding of endogenous b2GPI to post-ischemic myocardium and resulted in smaller myocardial infarction size in both WT and b2GPI deficient mice. Domain V treatment in WT mice also resulted in less neutrophil infiltration, less apoptosis and improved ejection fraction at 24 h. Rag-1 -/- antibody deficient mice reconstituted with IgM NAbs confirmed that Domain V prevented IgM NAb induced cardiac IRI. Domain V remained equally effective when delivered at the time of reperfusion which has therapeutic clinical relevance.Based upon this study Domain V may function as a universal inhibitor of IgM NAb binding in the setting of cardiac IRI, which offers promise as a new therapeutic strategy in the treatment of cardiac IRI.

27022585|t|EVOLUTION OF SLIPPED CAPITAL FEMORAL EPIPHYSIS AFTER NONSURGICAL TREATMENT.
27022585|a|To evaluate the efficacy of conservative treatment of patients with slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) and the complications due to the progression of the disease. METHODS: 18 patients (26 hips) seen consecutively from December 1996 to August 2006 at the Orthopedics Service of Santa Casa de Miseric  rdia de S  o Paulo, who had been referred from other services with a diagnosis of SCFE and were treated without surgery, were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Slip progression occurred in 19 hips (73%). Among the mild cases, eight remained mild, four became moderate and one became severe, according to the Southwick classification. Four out of the six originally moderate cases became severe and the two already severe cases worsened. CONCLUSION: Although today there is a consensus regarding the indication of surgical treatment for SCFE to prevent progression, some cases with confirmed diagnoses are still being treated conservatively. This is a major error, since it implies increased morbidity of the disease.

27168451|t|Clinical and laboratory considerations for the rapid detection of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.
27168451|a|UNASSIGNED: Carbapenem resistance among the Enterobacteriaceae has become a significant clinical and public health dilemma. Rapid administration of effective antimicrobials and implementation of supplemental infection control practices is required to both improve patient outcomes and limit the spread of these highly resistant organisms. However, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE)-infected patients are predominantly identified by routine culture methods, which take days to perform. Rapid genomic and phenotypic methods are currently available to accelerate the identification of carbapenemase-producing CRE. Effective use of these technologies is reliant on close collaboration between clinical microbiology, infection prevention, antimicrobial stewardship and infectious diseases specialists. This review discusses the performance characteristics of these technologies to date, and describes strategies for their optimal implementation.

27166227|t|O antigen of Franconibacter pulveris G3872 (O1) is a 4-deoxy-D-arabino-hexose-containing polysaccharide synthesized by the ABC transporter-dependent pathway.
27166227|a|UNASSIGNED: Bacteria Franconibacter (Enterobacter, Cronobacter) pulveris   share several typical characteristics with, and hence pose a challenge for detection of, Cronobacter sakazakii, an emerging opportunistic pathogen, which can cause severe infections in neonates. A structurally variable O polysaccharide (OPS) called O antigen provides the major basis for typing of gram-negative bacteria. We investigated structure and genetics of the O antigen of F. pulveris   G3872 (designated O1). An OPS was isolated by mild alkaline degradation of the lipopolysaccharide whereas the same polysaccharide and its oligosaccharide fragments were obtained by mild acid degradation. Studies by sugar analysis and NMR spectroscopy showed that the OPS contains D-ribose, L-rhamnose, and a rarely occurring monosaccharide 4-deoxy-D-arabino-hexose, and the OPS structure was established. The O-antigen gene cluster of F. pulveris G3872 between JUMPStart and gnd genes includes putative genes for glycosyltransferases, ABC transporter genes wzm and wzt, and genes for synthesis of L-rhamnose but no genes for synthesis of 4-deoxy-D-arabino-hexose. A mutation test with wzm gene confirmed that the OPS is synthesized and exported by the ABC transporter-dependent pathway. A trifunctional transferase was suggested to catalyze formation of two glycosidic linkages and adding a methyl group to the non-reducing end of the OPS to terminate the chain elongation. A carbohydrate-binding module that presumably recognizes the terminal methyl-modified monosaccharide was found at the C-terminus of Wzt. Primers specific for F. pulveris G3872 were designed based on wzm gene, which has a potential to be used for identification and detection of the O1 serogroup.

We aimed to investigate whether the prognosis and required duration of anticoagulation in CVT patients differ according to the provoking risk factors. Methods: Prospectively recorded data from a tertiary medical center in South Korea were retrospectively reviewed. CVTs were categorized into three groups: unprovoked, those with possibly resolved provoking factors (PR), and those with persistent provoking factors (PP). The baseline characteristics, treatment, and prognosis of patients in these three groups were analyzed. Results: From 2000 to 2015, 61 patients presented with CVT: 19 (31.1%) unprovoked, 11 (18.0%) with PR, and 31 (50.9%) with PP. The patients in our cohort had a slight female predominance and lower frequency of oral contraceptive use compared to Western cohorts. Median follow-up and duration of anticoagulation were 35 and 8 months, respectively. Despite the similarities in baseline characteristics, deaths (n= 3; P= 0.256) and recurrences (n= 7; P= 0.020) were observed only in the PP group. The median intervals to death and recurrence were 9 and 13 months, respectively. Death was associated with underlying disease activity, not with CVT progression. Recurrences in the PP group were associated with lack of anticoagulation (P= 0.012). Conclusions: Although the prognosis of CVT is generally benign in Koreans, recurrence and death were observed in patients with persistent risk factors, suggesting their need for long-term treatment with anticoagulants.

27164934|t|Regeneration of Liver Function Capacity After Partial Liver Resection is Impaired in Case of Postoperative Bile Leakage.
27164934|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative bile leakage (PBL) is a major surgical complication after partial liver resection resulting in increased perioperative morbidity and mortality. Previous experimental studies have shown an adverse effect on functional liver regeneration, but there are still no data available concerning these effects in humans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective matched pair analysis was carried out comparing the postoperative course of 51 patients with PBL to 51 patients without PBL. The influence of PBL on actual liver function was determined by means of LiMAx, Indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate (ICG-PDR), and standard liver function tests. RESULTS: The analyzed groups were matched regarding demographic, preoperative, and operative data. Bilirubin, ICG-PDR and LiMAx showed delayed postoperative functional recovery after partial liver resection in the PBL group compared to the non-PBL group. LiMAx was the single parameter to assess differing liver regeneration continuously from the 3rd to 14th postoperative day between the groups. A subanalysis revealed an early recovery from impaired functional regeneration if the bile leakage was diagnosed until the 5th postoperative day (POD) or successfully treated until the 14th POD. CONCLUSION: These are the first data evaluating the impact of PBL on functional regeneration after liver surgery. Liver regeneration after partial liver resection is impaired by PBL. However, a nearly normal recovery is possible if the bile leak is diagnosed early and immediately treated. Moreover, patients presenting with delayed functional recovery in the postoperative course are likely to have complications, e.g., bile leakage.

27136659|t|Prevalence of Body Dysmorphic Disorder and Muscle Dysmorphia Among Entry-Level Military Personnel.
27136659|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) and muscle dysmorphia (MD) in enlisted U.S. military personnel; and secondarily, to determine supplement use and relationship with BDD and MD. METHODS: A survey of advanced individual training of tri-service personnel at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, was performed combining the dysmorphia concern questionnaire, the MD symptom questionnaire, a supplement questionnaire, and demographic factors. RESULTS: Of the 1,320 service members approached, 1,150 (87.1%) completed the survey. The majority of participants were male, 62.8% (n = 722) and Army soldiers 59.0% (n = 679). The prevalence rate of BDD was 13.0% in males and 21.7% in females. The prevalence of MD was 12.7% in males and 4.2% in females. There was a strong correlation between having BDD and using supplements to get thinner (odds ratio 5.1; 95% confidence interval 3.4-7.8; p < 0.001) and MD to get more muscular (odds ratio 5.4; 95% confidence interval 3.5-8.3; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows a higher than expected prevalence rate of BDD and MD in service members. This indicates a need for increased awareness of dysmorphias in mental health providers, primary care providers, and commanders and justifies further military specific BDD and MD research.

27015393|t|Critical reappraisal of DBS targeting for movement disorders.
27015393|a|UNASSIGNED: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is used as a surgical treatment of movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, dystonia and essential tremor. Fundamental understanding of DBS effects on the pathological neural circuitry remains insufficient. In 2002 DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the globus pallidus internus (GPi) was approved for use in patients with PD. Next year, DBS of Gpi and STN for dystonia received a Humanitarian Device exemption from the FDA. The commonly targets for DBS are subthalamic nucleus (STN) or globus pallidus internus (GPi) for Parkinson's disease, Gpi for dystonia and ventro- intermediate (VIM) nucleus of the thalamus for essential tremor. However Vim DBS cannot sufficiently improve akinesia and rigidity. Pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) is currently investigated as potential target to improve gait and posture. It is determined that DBS sometimes influences not only motor functions but also the cognitive and affective functions of patients. In this article we review the present state of DBS for movement disorders, appropriate indications, practical effects and stimulation-induced adverse events established in previous studies. We discuss target selection and the effect of DBS on motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, dystonia and essential tremor.

27012376|t|Calorimetric studies of the growth of anaerobic microbes.
27012376|a|UNASSIGNED: This article aims to validate the use of calorimetry to measure the growth of anaerobic microbes. It has been difficult to monitor the growth of strict anaerobes while maintaining optimal growth conditions. Traditionally, optical density and ATP concentration are usually used as measures of the growth of anaerobic microbes. However, to take these measurements it is necessary to extract an aliquot of the culture, which can be difficult while maintaining anaerobic conditions. In this study, calorimetry was used to continuously and nondestructively measure the heat generated by the growth of anaerobic microbes as a function of time. Clostridium acetobutylicum, Clostridium beijerinckii, and Clostridium cellulovorans were used as representative anaerobic microbes. Using a multiplex isothermal calorimeter, we observed that peak time (tp) of C.  acetobutylicum heat evolution increased as the inoculation rate decreased. This strong correlation between the inoculation rate and tp showed that it was possible to measure the growth rate of anaerobic microbes by calorimetry. Overall, our results showed that there is a very good correlation between heat evolution and optical density/ATP concentration, validating the use of the method.

27012525|t|Quantitative analysis of human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) tissue expression in transgenic mice by online peptide immuno-affinity LC-HRMS.
27012525|a|UNASSIGNED: Neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is the homeostatic receptor responsible for the long half-life of endogenous IgG by protecting it from lysosomal degradation. Understanding systemic FcRn tissue expression is important to predict and design the half-life of therapeutic antibodies and Fc-coupled biotherapeutics. To this end, we measured human FcRn (hFcRn) tissue expression in Tg32, a human FcRn knock-in transgenic mouse model, for which a strong correlation of drug clearance to humans has been demonstrated. Building an hFcRn tissue expression profile in Tg32 was enabled by the development of a tissue preparation procedure composed of bead based protein extraction and protein precipitation using acetone followed by pellet digestion with trypsin. Digests were then loaded onto an online peptide immuno-affinity flow configuration hyphenated with reverse phase nanoflow chromatography and coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry to quantify hFcRn derived peptides. The workflow allowed bypassing some of the challenges typically associated with membrane protein analysis. We demonstrated acceptable precision and bias for measuring hFcRn in tissue matrices, typically within 20 % coefficient of variation and relative error. We also report hFcRn expression in several Tg32 tissues. We anticipate that establishing a quantitative approach for hFcRn in tissues will enable the direct measurement of hFcRn concentrations to further increase the accuracy of physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models for PK prediction of Fc-containing biotherapeutics. This is anticipated to improve the translation of pharmacokinetic data from preclinical model systems to humans.

27013870|t|Correlation between bone mineral density and serum trace elements in response to supervised aerobic training in older adults.
27013870|a|BACKGROUND: Life style and physical activity play a pivotal role in prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. The mechanism for better bone metabolism and improvement of physical disorders is not clear yet. Trace minerals such as Ca, Mn, Cu, and Zn are essential precursors for most vital biological process, especially those of bone health. OBJECTIVE: The main target of this study was evaluating the effective role of supervised aerobic exercise for 1 hour/day, 3 days/week for 12 weeks in the functions of trace elements in bone health through measuring bone mineral density (BMD), osteoporosis (T-score), bone markers, and trace element concentrations in healthy subjects aged 30-60 years with age average of 41.2  4.9. METHODS: A total of 100 healthy subjects (47 males, 53 females; age range 30-60 years) were recruited for this study. Based on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan analysis, the participants were classified into three groups: normal (n=30), osteopenic (n=40), and osteoporotic (n=30). Following, 12 weeks of moderate aerobic exercise, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), BMD, T-score, and trace elements such as Ca, Mn, Cu, and Zn were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. RESULTS: Significant improvement in serum BAP level, T-score, and BMD were observed in all participants following 12 weeks of moderate exercise. Participants with osteopenia and osteoporosis showed significant increase in serum Ca and Mn, along with decrease in serum Cu and Zn levels following 12 weeks of aerobic training. In control group, the improvements in serum trace elements and body mass index were significantly linked with the enhancement in the levels of BAP, BMD hip, and BMD spine. These results supported the preventive effects of moderate exercise in healthy subjects against osteoporosis. In both sexes, the changes in serum trace elements significantly correlated (P<0.05) with the improvement in BAP, BMD hip, BMD spine, and body mass index in all groups. CONCLUSION: The observed changes in the levels of Ca, Mn, Cu, and Zn were shown to be positively correlated with improved bone mass density among control and osteoporosis subjects of both sexes. These results demonstrate that aerobic exercise of moderate intensity might protect bone and cartilage by regulation of body trace elements which are involved in the biosynthesis of bone matrix structures and inhibition of bone resorption process via a proposed anti-free radical mechanism.

27075258|t|Disentangling the effect of body size and phylogenetic distances on zooplankton top-down control of algae.
27075258|a|A negative consequence of biodiversity loss is reduced rates of ecosystem functions. Phylogenetic-based biodiversity indices have been claimed to provide more accurate predictions of ecosystem functioning than species diversity alone. This approach assumes that the most relevant traits for ecosystem functioning present a phylogenetic signal. Yet, traits-mediating niche partitioning and resource uptake efficiency in animals can be labile. To assess the relative power of a key trait (body size) and phylogeny to predict zooplankton top-down control on phytoplankton, we manipulated trait and phylogenetic distances independently in microcosms while holding species richness constant. We found that body size provided strong predictions of top-down control. In contrast, phylogeny was a poor predictor of grazing rates. Size-related grazing efficiency asymmetry was mechanistically more important than niche differences in mediating ecosystem function in our experimental settings. Our study demonstrates a strong link between a single functional trait (i.e. body size) in zooplankton and trophic interactions, and urges for a cautionary use of phylogenetic information and taxonomic diversity as substitutes for trait information to predict and understand ecosystem functions.

27072717|t|Advances and Progress in Chagas Disease Drug Discovery.
27072717|a|UNASSIGNED: Chagas disease represents a serious burden for millions of people worldwide. Transmitted by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, this neglected tropical disease causes more than 10,000 deaths each year and is the main cause of heart failure in Latin America, where it is endemic. Although most cases are concentrated in Latin American countries, Chagasdisease has been increasingly reported in non-endemic regions, where thelow level of public awareness on the subject contributes to the growing prevalence of the disease.The available medicines are characterized by several safety and efficacy drawbacks that prevent millions of people, particularly those with advanced disease, from receiving adequate treatment.This urgent need has stimulated the emergenceof diverse initiatives dedicated to the research and development (R_D) of noveltherapeutic agents for Chagas disease. Public-privatepartnerships havebeen responsible for a significant increase in the investments in R_D programsand major advancements have been achieved over the past ten years.A number of collaborative projects have been leveraged by this organizational model, which privileges sharing of data, expertise, and resources between research institutions and pharmaceutical companies.Among the currentstrategies employed by these consortia, target-based and phenotypic screenings have achieved the most promising results.This article provides an overview onthe current status and recent advances in Chagas disease drug discovery.

27168785|t|Gas chromatography-mass spectrometric method-based urine metabolomic profile of rats with pelvic inflammatory disease.
27168785|a|UNASSIGNED: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) can lead to a poor outcome of severe sequelae, and the current methods of clinical diagnosis are not satisfactory. Metabolomics is an effective method for the identification of disease-related metabolite biomarkers to facilitate disease diagnosis. However, to the best of our knowledge, no PID-associated metabolomic study has yet been carried out. The metabolomic changes of rats with PID were investigated in the present study. A PID model was constructed by the multi-pathogenic infection of the upper genital tract in rats. Infiltration of inflammatory cells and elevated expression levels of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1b and IL-6 in the uterus and fallopian tubes validated the disease model. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry coupled with derivatization was used to determine the urine metabolomic profile. Principal component analysis and partial least squares-discriminant analysis of the data sets showed a clear separation of metabolic profiles between rats with PID and control rats. Eighteen differentiating metabolites were found, including four amino acids, three fatty acids, nine organic acids, and two sugars, which indicated alterations in sugar metabolism, the citric acid cycle, amino acid metabolism and fatty acid metabolism. These metabolites could be potential biomarkers of PID, and this research may offer a new approach to evaluate the effect of anti-PID drugs in pre-clinical or clinical trials.

27168863|t|Low-intensity noninvasive ventilation: Lower pressure, more exacerbations of chronic respiratory failure.
27168863|a|BACKGROUND: For patients with chronic respiratory failure (CRF) who are treated with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), a little is known regarding the effects of low-intensity NPPV (LI-NPPV) on the clinical course of CRF and the frequency of adjustments in these patients. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the effects of LI-NPPV on the clinical course of patients with CRF as compared with patients who were treated with conventional NPPV (C-NPPV) and determined how frequently NPPV was adjusted during therapy. METHODS: Clinical data from 21 patients who received long-term NPPV were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were categorized into two groups based on the level of initial pressure support (PS): C-NPPV group (PS >=  10 cm H2O) and LI-NPPV group (PS < 10 cm H2O). RESULTS: Patients in the LI-NPPV group had significantly more exacerbations of CRF (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the number of patients who required adjustments of NPPV settings between the two groups. There was no significant difference in PaCO2 levels 1 month after the start of NPPV between the two groups; however, PaCO2 levels were significantly lower after 1 year in the C-group (P < 0.001). Seventy-one percent of LI-NPPV patients and 43% of C-NPPV patients needed NPPV adjustments. CONCLUSIONS: Attention should be paid to CRF patients who are initially administered LI-NPPV; they should be carefully observed because they can develop more exacerbations of CRF than patients undergoing C-NPPV. If possible, higher initial PS should be administered to prevent CRF exacerbations.

27082138|t|Maladaptive daydreaming: Evidence for an under-researched mental health disorder.
27082138|a|UNASSIGNED: This study explores the recently described phenomenon of Maladaptive Daydreaming (MD) and attempts to enhance the understanding of its features. It documents the experiences of 340 self-identified maladaptive daydreamers who spend excessive amounts of time engaged in mental fantasy worlds, in comparison to 107 controls. Our sample included a total of 447 individuals, aged 13-78, from 45 countries who responded to online announcements. Participants answered quantitative and qualitative questions about their daydreaming habits and completed seven questionnaires assessing mental health symptoms. Findings demonstrated that MD differs significantly from normative daydreaming in terms of quantity, content, experience, controllability, distress, and interference with life functioning. Results also demonstrated that Maladaptive Daydreamers endorsed significantly higher rates of attention deficit, obsessive compulsive and dissociation symptoms than controls. In sum, findings suggested that MD represents an under-acknowledged clinical phenomenon that causes distress, hinders life functioning and requires more scientific and clinical attention.

27027998|t|The WEE1 regulators CPEB1 and miR-15b switch from inhibitor to activators at G2/M.
27027998|a|UNASSIGNED: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) in the AGO-containing RISC complex control messenger RNA (mRNA) translation by binding to mRNA 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). The relationship between miRNAs and other regulatory factors that also bind to mRNA 3'UTR, such as CPEB1 (cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein), remains elusive. We found that both CPEB1 and miR-15b control the expression of WEE1, a key mammalian cell cycle regulator. Together, they repress WEE1 protein expression during G1 and S-phase. Interestingly, the 2 factors lose their inhibitory activity at the G2/M transition, at the time of the cell cycle when WEE1 expression is maximal, and, moreover, rather activate WEE1 translation in a synergistic manner. Our data show that translational regulation by RISC and CPEB1 is essential in cell cycle control and, most importantly, is coordinated, and can be switched from inhibition to activation during the cell cycle.

27022464|t|Chronic P-glycoprotein inhibition increases the brain concentration of escitalopram: potential implications for treating depression.
27022464|a|Recent preclinical studies have revealed a functionally important role for the drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein (P-gp) at the blood-brain barrier in limiting brain levels and thus antidepressant-like activity of certain antidepressant drugs. Specifically, acute administration of P-gp inhibitors, such as verapamil and cyclosporin A (CsA), has been shown to augment brain concentrations and functional activity of the antidepressant escitalopram in rodents. However, depression is a chronic disorder and current treatments require prolonged administration to elicit their full therapeutic effect. Thus, it is important to investigate whether acute findings in relation to P-gp inhibition translate to chronic paradigms. To this end, the present study investigates whether chronic treatment with the P-gp inhibitor verapamil and the antidepressant escitalopram results in enhanced brain distribution and antidepressant-like effects of escitalopram. Verapamil (10  mg  kg(-1) i.p.) and escitalopram (0.1  mg  kg(-1) i.p.) were administered once daily for 22  days. On the final day of treatment, brain regions and plasma were collected for analysis of cortical and plasma escitalopram concentrations, and to determine the hippocampal expression of genes previously reported to be altered by chronic antidepressant treatment. Verapamil treatment resulted in a greater than twofold increase in brain levels of escitalopram, without altering plasma levels. Neither gene expression analysis nor behavioral testing revealed an augmentation of responses to escitalopram treatment due to verapamil administration. Taken together, these data demonstrate for the first time that P-gp inhibition can yield elevated brain concentrations of an antidepressant after chronic treatment. The functional relevance of these increased brain levels requires further elaboration.

27023876|t|How I do it: novel parastomal herniorrhaphy utilizing transversus abdominis release.
27023876|a|INTRODUCTION: Parastomal hernias are a complex surgical problem affecting a large number of patients. Recurrences continue to occur despite various methods of repair. We present a novel method of open parastomal hernia repair with retromuscular mesh reinforcement in a modified Sugarbaker configuration. METHODS: A full mildline laparotomy is performed and all adhesions are taken down. We then perform an open parastomal hernia repair by utilizing retromuscular dissection, posterior component separation via transversus abdominis release, and lateralization of the bowel utilizing a modified Sugarbaker mesh configuration within the retromuscular space. We demonstrate this technique in a cadaveric model for illustrative purposes. DISCUSSION: This repair provides the benefits of an open posterior component separation with transversus abdominis release and maintains the biomechanics of a functional abdominal wall, all while simultaneously benefitting from the advantages of mesh reinforcement in a modified Sugarbaker configuration. Our clinical experience with this novel technique to this point has been positive.

27006659|t|Synergistic Interaction of Methanol Extract from Canarium odontophyllum Miq. Leaf in Combination with Oxacillin against Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ATCC 33591.
27006659|a|Canarium odontophyllum (CO) Miq. has been considered as one of the most sought-after plant species in Sarawak, Malaysia, due to its nutritional and pharmacological benefits. This study aimed to evaluate the pharmacodynamic interaction of crude methanol and acetone extracts from CO leaves in combination with oxacillin, vancomycin, and linezolid, respectively, against MRSA ATCC 33591 as preliminary study has reported its potential antistaphylococcal activity. The broth microdilution assay revealed that both methanol and acetone extracts were bactericidal with Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of 312.5    g/mL and 156.25    g/mL and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) of 625    g/mL and 312.5    g/mL, respectively. Fractional Inhibitory Concentration (FIC) indices were obtained via the chequerboard dilution assay where methanol extract-oxacillin, acetone extract-oxacillin, methanol extract-linezolid, and acetone extract-linezolid combinations exhibited synergism (FIC index  <= 0.5). The synergistic action of the methanol extract-oxacillin combination was verified by time-kill analysis where bactericidal effect was observed at concentration of 1/8 * MIC of both compounds at 9.6   h compared to oxacillin alone. As such, these findings postulated that both extracts exert their anti-MRSA mechanism of action similar to that of vancomycin and provide evidence that the leaves of C. odontophyllum have the potential to be developed into antistaphylococcal agents.

27004824|t|The role of micro health insurance in providing financial risk protection in developing countries- a systematic review.
27004824|a|BACKGROUND: Out of pocket payments are the predominant method of financing healthcare in many developing countries, which can result in impoverishment and financial catastrophe for those affected. In 2010, WHO estimated that approximately 100 million people are pushed below the poverty line each year by payments for healthcare. Micro health insurance (MHI) has been used in some countries as means of risk pooling and reducing out of pocket health expenditure. A systematic review was conducted to assess the extent to which MHI has contributed to providing financial risk protection to low-income households in developing countries, and suggest how the findings can be applied in the Pakistani setting. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search for published literature using the search terms "Community based health insurance AND developing countries", "Micro health insurance AND developing countries", "Mutual health insurance AND developing countries", "mutual OR micro OR community based health insurance" "Health insurance AND impact AND poor" "Health insurance AND financial protection" and "mutual health organizations" on three databases, Pubmed, Google Scholar and Science Direct (Elsevier). Only those records that were published in the last ten years, in English language with their full texts available free of cost, were considered for inclusion in this review. Hand searching was carried out on the reference lists of the retrieved articles and webpages of international organizations like World Bank, World Health Organization and International Labour Organization. RESULTS: Twenty-three articles were eligible for inclusion in this systematic review (14 from Asia and 9 from Africa). Our analysis shows that MHI, in the majority of cases, has been found to contribute to the financial protection of its beneficiaries, by reducing out of pocket health expenditure, catastrophic health expenditure, total health expenditure, household borrowings and poverty. MHI also had a positive safeguarding effect on household savings, assets and consumption patterns. CONCLUSION: Our review suggests that MHI, targeted at the low-income households and tailored to suit the cultural and geographical structures in the various areas of Pakistan, may contribute towards providing protection to the households from catastrophe and impoverishment resulting from health expenditures. This paper emphasizes the need for further research to fill the knowledge gap that exists about the impact of MHI, using robust study designs and impact indicators.

27006628|t|Inside the Pan-genome - Methods and Software Overview.
27006628|a|The number of genomes that have been deposited in databases has increased exponentially after the advent of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), which produces high-throughput sequence data; this circumstance has demanded the development of new bioinformatics software and the creation of new areas, such as comparative genomics. In comparative genomics, the genetic content of an organism is compared against other organisms, which helps in the prediction of gene function and coding region sequences, identification of evolutionary events and determination of phylogenetic relationships. However, expanding comparative genomics to a large number of related bacteria, we can infer their lifestyles, gene repertoires and minimal genome size. In this context, a powerful approach called Pan-genome has been initiated and developed. This approach involves the genomic comparison of different strains of the same species, or even genus. Its main goal is to establish the total number of non-redundant genes that are present in a determined dataset. Pan-genome consists of three parts: core genome; accessory or dispensable genome; and species-specific or strain-specific genes. Furthermore, pan-genome is considered to be "open" as long as new genes are added significantly to the total repertoire for each new additional genome and "closed" when the newly added genomes cannot be inferred to significantly increase the total repertoire of the genes. To perform all of the required calculations, a substantial amount of software has been developed, based on orthologous and paralogous gene identification.

27129104|t|Multilevel non-volatile data storage utilizing common current hysteresis of networked single walled carbon nanotubes.
27129104|a|UNASSIGNED: The characteristic source-drain current hysteresis frequently observed in field-effect transistors with networked single walled carbon-nanotube (NSWNT) channels is problematic for the reliable switching and sensing performance of devices. But the two distinct current states of the hysteresis curve at a zero gate voltage can be useful for memory applications. In this work, we demonstrate a novel non-volatile transistor memory with solution-processed NSWNTs which are suitable for multilevel data programming and reading. A polymer passivation layer with a small amount of water employed on the top of the NSWNT channel serves as an efficient gate voltage dependent charge trapping and de-trapping site. A systematic investigation evidences that the water mixed in a polymer passivation solution is critical for reliable non-volatile memory operation. The optimized device is air-stable and temperature-resistive up to 80   C and exhibits excellent non-volatile memory performance with an on/off current ratio greater than 10(4), a switching time less than 100 ms, data retention longer than 4000 s, and write/read endurance over 100 cycles. Furthermore, the gate voltage dependent charge injection mediated by water in the passivation layer allowed for multilevel operation of our memory in which 4 distinct current states were programmed repetitively and preserved over a long time period.

27126658|t|MH17: the Malaysian experience.
27126658|a|A disaster is a natural or man-made (or technological) hazard resulting in an event of substantial extent causing significant physical damage or destruction, loss of life, or drastic change to the environment. It is a phenomenon that can cause damage to life and property and destroy the economic, social and cultural life of the people; and overwhelms the capacity of the community to cope with the event. The recent tragic aviation accidents in 2014 involving Malaysia Airlines flights MH370 and MH17 shocked the world in an unprecedented manner. This paper focuses on the Malaysian experience in the MH17 mission in Ukraine as well as the first ever international Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) operation for the Malaysian DVI team. The DVI operations in Hilversum, the Netherlands were well described in stages. The Netherlands' Landelijk Team Forensische Opsporing as the lead DVI team in Hilversum operated systematically, ensuring the success of the whole mission. This paper discusses the lessons learned by the Malaysian team on proper DVI structure, inter- and intra-agency cooperation, facilities planning and set up, logistics and health and safety aspects, as well as effective communication and collaboration with other international delegates. Several issues and challenges faced by the Malaysian team were also documented. In addition, the authors shared views, opinions and recommendations for a more comprehensive DVI operation in the future.

27011480|t|Tracheotomy in Cancer Patients: Experience from a Cancer Hospital in Pakistan.
27011480|a|UNASSIGNED: Tracheotomy is commonly performed for the management of upper airway compromise. Trauma and head and neck cancers are the most frequent indications. The objective of this study was to share our experience with tracheotomy performed for a broad range of malignancies including but not limited to head and neck cancer. This study is a retrospective case series of patients who underwent tracheotomy from January 2004 to June 2012 at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Lahore, Pakistan. A total of 130 patients were included in the study. Patient demographics, indications for tracheotomy, underlying malignancy, and duration of follow-up were assessed. Main indications were elective (prolonged intubation and/or as a prerequisite for head and neck cancer surgery) and emergency (stridor). Outcome was assessed on a basis of successful decannulation and complications related to tracheotomy. Indications for tracheotomy were elective in 55 (44.7  %) and emergent in 75 (55.3  %) patients. Most common underlying malignancy was leukemia/lymphoma in 38 (29.2  %) patients. There were seven (5.3  %) complications in emergency tracheotomies including bleeding in three, emphysema in two, and dislodgement and infection in one patient each. In the elective setting, three (2.3  %) complications were observed with dislodgement in one and stomal stenosis in two patients. Decannulation was successfully carried out in 23 (18  %) patients. Median follow-up of patients was 1  month (range 0-86). No tracheotomy-related mortality was observed. Tracheotomy was performed with relative safety in cancer patients, but low rate of successful decannulation predominantly due to persistent nature of disease.

27009043|t|The Mechanism of Germline Sex Determination in Vertebrates.
27009043|a|UNASSIGNED: Germ cells are the common cells of origin for both types of two different gametes: sperm and eggs. In vertebrates so far examined, the sex of germ cells is determined by gonadal somatic cells. However, influenced by the somatic cells, how germ cells adopt their sexual fates by intrinsic factors has long been unclear in vertebrates. We recently identified forkhead box L3 (Foxl3) as a germ cell-intrinsic factor involved in the sperm-egg fate decision in the teleost fish, medaka (Oryzias latipes). On the basis of the results obtained by the analysis offoxl3/Foxl3 expression and loss-of-function mutants, we review when and how germ cell sex is regulated non-cell autonomously and cell-autonomously. We then discuss that the germline sex determination pathway is genetically distinct from other essential gametogenic pathways such as meiotic entry and the establishment of germline stem cells. Another extraordinary finding in thefoxl3mutant is that functional sperm can be produced in the ovary, which provides a new notion that gametogenesis can proceed irrespective of the sex of the surrounding somatic cells once the sexual identity of germ cells is established in medaka.

27097099|t|A new species of Tanycarpa F  rster (1862) (Hymenoptera, Braconidae: Alysiinae) from Itatiaia National Park, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
27097099|a|UNASSIGNED: This is the first description of a species of the genusTanycarpa F  rster (1862) for Brazil. Forty-eight specimens were collected in High Montane Dense Ombrophilous Forest area at National Park of Itatiaia, RJ, using four Malaise traps installed, respectively, at four different altitudes. This study is based on a description of two species ofTanycarpa from Colombia, Tanycarpa edithaeand Tanycarpa sarmientoi, which are the only species of this genus recognized for the neotropics.

27104814|t|Diffusion of macromolecules in a polymer hydrogel: from microscopic to macroscopic scales.
27104814|a|UNASSIGNED: To gain insight into the fundamental processes determining the motion of macromolecules in polymeric matrices, the dynamical hindrance of polymeric dextran molecules diffusing as probe through a polyacrylamide hydrogel is systematically explored. Three complementary experimental methods combined with Brownian dynamics simulations are used to study a broad range of dextran molecular weights and salt concentrations. While multi-parameter fluorescence image spectroscopy (MFIS) is applied to investigate the local diffusion of single molecules on a microscopic length scale inside the hydrogel, a macroscopic transmission imaging (MTI) fluorescence technique and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) are used to study the collective motion of dextrans on the macroscopic scale. These fundamentally different experimental methods, probing different length scales of the system, yield long-time diffusion coefficients for the dextran molecules which agree quantitatively. The measured diffusion coefficients decay markedly with increasing molecular weight of the dextran and fall onto a master curve. The observed trends of the hindrance factors are consistent with Brownian dynamics simulations. The simulations also allow us to estimate the mean pore size for the herein investigated experimental conditions. In addition to the diffusing molecules, MFIS detects temporarily trapped molecules inside the matrix with diffusion times above 10 ms, which is also confirmed by anisotropy analysis. The fraction of bound molecules depends on the ionic strength of the solution and the charge of the dye. Using fluorescence intensity analysis, also MTI confirms the observation of the interaction of dextrans with the hydrogel. Moreover, pixelwise analysis permits to show significant heterogeneity of the gel on the microscopic scale.

27055984|t|TRAINING SPECIFIC FUNCTIONAL, NEURAL AND HYPERTROPHIC ADAPTATIONS TO EXPLOSIVE- VS. SUSTAINED-CONTRACTION STRENGTH TRAINING.
27055984|a|UNASSIGNED: Training specificity is considered important for strength training, although the functional and underpinning physiological adaptations to different types of training, including brief explosive contractions, are poorly understood. This study compared the effects of 12-wks of explosive-contraction (ECT, n=13) vs. sustained-contraction (SCT, n=16) strength training vs. control (CON, n=14) on the functional, neural, hypertrophic, and intrinsic contractile characteristics of healthy young men. Training involved 40 isometric repetitions (x3/wk): contracting as fast and hard as possible for ~1 s (ECT); or gradually increasing to 75% of maximum voluntary torque (MVT) before holding for 3 s (SCT). Torque and EMG during maximum and explosive contractions, torque during evoked octet contractions, and total quadriceps muscle volume (QUADSVOL) were quantified pre- and post-training. MVT increased more after SCT than EST (23 vs. 17%; effect size [ES]=0.69), with similar increases in neural drive, but greater QUADSVOL changes after SCT (8.1 vs. 2.6%; ES=0.74). ECT improved explosive torque at all time points (17-34%; 0.54 <=ES <=0.76) due to increased neural drive (17-28%), whereas only late-phase explosive torque (150 ms, +12%; ES=1.48) and corresponding neural drive (18%) increased after SCT. Changes in evoked torque indicated slowing of the contractile properties of the muscle-tendon unit after both training interventions. These results showed training-specific functional changes that appeared to be due to distinct neural and hypertrophic adaptations. ECT produced a wider range of functional adaptations than SCT, and given the lesser demands of ECT this type of training provides a highly efficient means of increasing function.

27033179|t|Treatment of experimental furcation perforations with mineral trioxide aggregate, platelet rich plasma or platelet rich fibrin in dogs' teeth.
27033179|a|UNASSIGNED: This work evaluates the effect of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), platelet rich plasma (PRP) or platelet rich fibrin (PRF) on healing of non-contaminated and contaminated furcation perforations. A total of 192 teeth of 12 dogs was divided into three equal groups according to evaluation period. Each group was further subdivided into MTA, PRP, PRF, negative and positive control subgroups. Each experimental subgroup was further subdivided according to perforation status into non-contaminated and contaminated subdivisions. Root canal therapy was carried out and furcation perforation was made in all teeth except in negative control subgroup. The furcation perforation was repaired immediately in subdivision (1) and after 4 weeks in subdivision (2). The change in vertical bone loss was measured by radiography. Inflammatory cell count, cemental deposition, new bone formation, bone resorption and epithelial proliferation were assessed. Both PRP and PRF demonstrated statistically significant reduction in vertical bone loss and inflammatory cell count than MTA. No significant difference was found between MTA, PRP and PRF in cemental deposition, new bone formation, bone resorption and epithelial proliferation. The non-contaminated teeth demonstrated better treatment outcomes than the contaminated teeth. In conclusion, PRP and PRF are successful treatment options for repairing of furcation perforation in both non-contaminated and contaminated teeth in dogs with superior outcomes in non contaminated teeth.

27013599|t|Role of institutional entrepreneurship in building adaptive capacity in community-based healthcare organisations: realist review protocol.
27013599|a|INTRODUCTION: Over the past 3 decades, there has been a substantial shift to the marketisation of government-funded health services. For organisations traditionally buffered from the competitive pressures of for-profit enterprises, such as community-based organisations, this means developing the capacity to adapt to competitive tendering processes, shifting client expectations, and increasing demands for greater accountability. Drawing on ideas of institutional entrepreneurship, we believe that attempts to build adaptive capacity require the transformation of existing institutional arrangements. Key in this may be identifying and fostering institutional entrepreneurs-actors who take the lead in being the impetus for, and giving direction to, structural change. This study focuses on the strategies used by institutional entrepreneurs to build adaptive capacity in the community-based healthcare sector. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The research will use an adapted rapid realist review. The review will find underlying theories that explain the circumstances surrounding the implementation of capacity-building strategies that shape organisational response and generate outcomes by activating causal mechanisms. An early scoping of the literature, and consultations with key stakeholders, will be undertaken to identify an initial programme theory. We will search for relevant journal articles and grey literature. Data will be extracted based on contextual factors, mechanisms and outcomes, and their configurations. The analysis will seek patterns and regularities in these configurations and will focus on confirming, refuting or refining our programme theory. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study does not involve primary research and, therefore, does not require formal ethical approval. However, ethical standards of utility, usefulness, feasibility, propriety, accuracy and accountability will be followed. The results will be written up according to the Realist and Meta-Review Evidence Synthesis: Evolving Standards guidelines. Once completed, findings will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42015026487.

27026922|t|Habitat preferences and conservation threats to Black-necked Cranes wintering in Bhutan.
27026922|a|Black-necked Crane (Grus nigricollis) is a vulnerable Red list species whose populations are declining. However, little is known about Black-necked Cranes' habitat requirements or the causes of their population decline. We identified Black-necked Cranes' winter roost and foraging preferences of Black-necked Cranes in Bhutan during the winter of 2013-2014. Black-necked Cranes' roosts were recorded using Garmin GPSmap 60CSx, while foraging preferences and threats to the birds were identified based on a survey of household heads (n  =  107) residing within a 3  km radius of roost sites. We grouped the threats identified by the communities into four major categories, viz. biological, social, political and natural threats based on the relevance. Of the four major threats, communities residing within the roosting and foraging habitat of the Black-necked Crane reported biological threat as major. Biological threats as reported by communities include loss of habitat, food shortage and competition from other animals. We recommend the present roosting areas be designated as part of the conservation areas for Black-necked Crane wintering in Bumthang district. In addition to preserving these areas, government should also encourage farming in foraging habitats of Black-necked Crane, because they mainly feed on barley, wheat, paddy, potatoes and buckwheat, besides roots, tubers and insects in the wetlands.

27052842|t|Canaloplasty in patients with uveitic glaucoma: a pilot study.
27052842|a|PURPOSE: Glaucoma is a common vision-threatening complication of uveitis. We investigated the outcome of canaloplasty in patients with chronic uveitis and uncontrolled secondary glaucoma. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 12 patients with medically uncontrolled secondary glaucoma who underwent canaloplasty (14 treated eyes), with follow-up of >=  24  months. The primary outcome measure was complete and qualified (requirement for anti-glaucomatous medication) surgical success rates, as determined by a reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) and the need for anti-glaucomatous medication. Secondary outcome measures were uveitis activity, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), vision-threatening complications, and secondary glaucoma surgery. RESULTS: Canaloplasty resulted in a significant IOP reduction, from a mean preoperative baseline level of 27.1        12.3  mmHg to a mean of 14.5        4.3  mmHg (p   =   0.01) at 24  months. Complete success (limit of 15  mmHg) was achieved in six patients and qualified success in one patient. However, failure was noted in five patients, two of whom required additional glaucoma surgery. Topical anti-glaucomatous medications were reduced from 2.7        1.2 (mean    SD) at baseline to 0.6        1.2 at 24  months (p   =   0.007). Uveitis activity did not increase after surgery. BCVA was not reduced; cataract progressed in two patients. CONCLUSION: At 2-year follow-up, overall success rate was 58  % (IOP    <=   15 with or without medication), and surgery failed in 5 eyes, 2 eyes requiring additional glaucoma surgery. No harmful complications or worsening of uveitis activity were noted.

27009355|t|Pairwise detection of site-specific receptor phosphorylations using single-molecule blotting.
27009355|a|Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) at the plasma membrane (PM) determine the signal transduction efficacy alone and in combination. However, current approaches to identify PTMs provide ensemble results, inherently overlooking combinatorial PTMs in a single polypeptide molecule. Here, we describe a single-molecule blotting (SiMBlot) assay that combines biotinylation of cell surface receptors with single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. This method enables quantitative measurement of the phosphorylation status of individual membrane receptor molecules and colocalization analysis of multiple immunofluorescence signals to directly visualize pairwise site-specific phosphorylation patterns at the single-molecule level. Strikingly, application of SiMBlot to study ligand-dependent epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation, which is widely thought to be multi-phosphorylated, reveals that EGFR on cell membranes is hardly multi-phosphorylated, unlike in vitro autophosphorylated EGFR. Therefore, we expect SiMBlot to aid understanding of vast combinatorial PTM patterns, which are concealed in ensemble methods, and to broaden knowledge of RTK signaling.

27030726|t|Computational prospecting the great viral unknown.
27030726|a|UNASSIGNED: Bacteriophage play an important role in host-driven biological processes by controlling bacterial population size, horizontally transferring genes between hosts, and expressing host-derived genes to alter host metabolism. Metagenomics provides the genetic basis for understanding the interplay between uncultured bacteria, their phage, and the environment. In particular, viral metagenomes (viromes) are providing new insight into phage-encoded host genes (i.e., auxiliary metabolic genes; AMGs) that reprogram host metabolism during infection. Yet, despite deep sequencing efforts of viral communities, the majority of sequences have no match to known proteins. Reference-independent computational techniques, such as protein clustering, contig spectra, and ecological profiling are overcoming these barriers to examine both the known and unknown components of viromes. As the field of viral metagenomics progresses, a critical assessment of tools is required as the majority of algorithms have been developed for analyzing bacteria. The aim of this paper is to offer an overview of current computational methodologies for virome analysis and to provide an example of reference-independent approaches using human skin viromes. Additionally, we present methods to carefully validate AMGs from host contamination. Despite computational challenges, these new methods offer novel insights into the diversity and functional roles of phage in diverse environments.

27069368|t|Identification of colorectal cancer-restricted microRNAs and their target genes based on high-throughput sequencing data.
27069368|a|To identify potential key microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target genes for colorectal cancer (CRC). High-throughput sequencing data of miRNA expression and gene expression (ID: GSE46622) were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus, including matched colon tumor, normal colon epithelium, and liver metastasis tissues from eight CRC patients. Paired t-test and NOISeq separately were utilized to identify differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) and genes. Then, target genes with differential expression and opposite expression trends were identified for DE-miRNAs. Combined with tumor suppressor gene, tumor-associated gene, and TRANSFAC databases, CRC-restricted miRNAs were screened out based on miRNA-target pairs. Compared with normal tissues, there were 56 up- and 37 downregulated miRNAs in metastasis tissues, as well as eight up- and 30 downregulated miRNAs in tumor tissues. miRNA-1 was downregulated in tumor and metastasis tissues, while its target oncogenes TWIST1 and GATA4 were upregulated. Besides, miRNA-let-7f-1-3p was downregulated in tumor tissues, which also targeted TWIST1. In addition, miRNA-133b and miRNA-4458 were downregulated in tumor tissues, while their common target gene DUSP9 was upregulated. Conversely, miRNA-450-b-3p was upregulated in metastasis tissues, while its target tumor suppressor gene CEACAM7 showed downregulation. The identified CRC-restricted miRNAs might be implicated in cancer progression via their target genes, suggesting their potential usage in CRC treatment.

27105142|t|Assessing the Efficacy of Tabs on Filtering Facepiece Respirator Straps to Increase Proper Doffing Techniques While Reducing Contact Transmission of Pathogens.
27105142|a|UNASSIGNED: NIOSH-certified N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) are used in healthcare settings as a control measure to mitigate exposures to airborne infectious particles. When the outer surface of an FFR becomes contaminated, it presents a contact transmission risk to the wearer. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance recommends that healthcare workers (HCWs) doff FFRs by grasping the straps at the back of the head to avoid contact with the potentially contaminated surface. Adherence to proper doffing technique is reportedly low due to numerous factors including difficulty in locating and grasping the straps. This study compares the impact of tabs placed on FFR straps to controls (without tabs) on proper doffing, ease of use and comfort, and reduction of transfer of contamination to the wearer. Utilizing a fluorescent agent as a tracer to track contamination from FFRs to hand and head areas of 20 human subjects demonstrated that there was no difference in tabbed FFR straps and controls with respect to promoting proper doffing (p = 0.48), but did make doffing easier (p = 0.04) as indicated by 7 of 8 subjects that used the tabs. Seven of the 20 subjects felt that FFRs with tabs were easier to remove, while only 2 of 20 indicated that FFRs without tabs were easier to remove. Discomfort was not a factor for either FFR strap type. When removing an FFR with contaminated hands, the use of the tabs significantly reduced the amount of tracer transfer compared to straps without tabs (p = 0.012). FFRs with tabs on the straps are associated with ease of doffing and significantly less transfer of the fluorescent tracer.

27070651|t|Diabetes mellitus and hypertension: a dual threat.
27070651|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The following is a review of the current concepts on the relationship between hypertension (HTN) and diabetes mellitus with a focus on the epidemiology and cardiovascular prognostic implications of coexistent HTN and diabetes mellitus, shared mechanisms underlying both conditions and pathophysiology of increased risk of cardiovascular disease, treatment of HTN in individuals with diabetes mellitus, and effects of anti-diabetic medications on blood pressure (BP). RECENT FINDINGS: Diabetes mellitus and HTN often coexist in the same individual. They share numerous risk factors and underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, most important of which are insulin resistance and inappropriate activation of the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Recently updated guidelines recommend a BP goal of 140/90 mmHg in most individuals with diabetes mellitus. A new class of anti-diabetic medications, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors, has shown favorable effects on BP. SUMMARY: HTN affects the majority of individuals with diabetes mellitus. Coexistence of diabetes mellitus and HTN, especially if BP is not well controlled, dramatically increases the risk of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. BP control is an essential part of management of patients with diabetes mellitus, because it is one of the most effective ways to prevent vascular complications and death.

27097751|t|Age-related differences in pulmonary effects of acute and subchronic episodic ozone exposures in Brown Norway rats.
27097751|a|UNASSIGNED: Ozone (O3) is known to induce adverse pulmonary and systemic health effects. Importantly, children and older persons are considered at-risk populations for O3-induced dysfunction, yet the mechanisms accounting for the age-related pulmonary responses to O3 are uncertain. In this study, we examined age-related susceptibility to O3 using 1   mo (adolescent), 4   mo (young adult), 12   mo (adult) and 24   mo (senescent) male Brown Norway rats exposed to filtered air or O3 (0.25 and 1.00   ppm), 6   h/day, two days/week for 1 week (acute) or 13 weeks (subchronic). Ventilatory function, assessed by whole-body plethysmography, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) biomarkers of injury and inflammation were used to examine O3-induced pulmonary effects. Relaxation time declined in all ages following the weekly exposures; however, this effect persisted only in the 24   mo rats following a five days recovery, demonstrating an inability to induce adaptation commonly seen with repeated O3 exposures. PenH was increased in all groups with an augmented response in the 4   mo rats following the subchronic O3 exposures. O3 led to increased breathing frequency and minute volume in the 1 and 4   mo animals. Markers of pulmonary permeability were increased in all age groups. Elevations in BALF y-glutamyl transferase activity and lung inflammation following an acute O3 exposure were noted in only the 1 and 4   mo rats, which likely received an increased effective O3 dose. These data demonstrate that adolescent and young adult animals are more susceptible to changes in ventilation and pulmonary injury/inflammation caused by acute and episodic O3 exposure.

27049619|t|Analysis, detection and quantitation of mixed cryoglobulins in HCV infection: brief review and case examples.
27049619|a|UNASSIGNED: Considering the high incidence of cryoglobulins in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection together with the high worldwide prevalence of HCV infection, identification of clinically apparent mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome is increasingly important as most patients who are identified can now be successfully treated. Different approaches for the detection, analysis and reporting of cryoglobulins have been described and there is a wide variation in results reported, ranging from a qualitative "negative" or "positive", to a quantitative report including cryoglobulin type and the total protein. Protein and immunofixation (IFE) electrophoresis are generally used to identify and characterize cryoglobulins, as these methods quantify and phenotype. Here, we present a brief review of the literature and demonstrate a case oriented approach for identifying mixed cryoglobulinemia from the preanalytical phase, leading up to and including the analytical phase with characterization by IFE. Most patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia can now be treated with success. Nevertheless, the high cost may limit treatment of those with symptoms unless there is laboratory evidence for mixed cryoglubulinemia. Low levels of cryoglobulins can be associated with severe symptoms; as a result, accurate identification of cryoglobulins may be of increasing importance since clear identification may be a good reason to initiate treatment.

27019516|t|Simultaneous confidence intervals that are compatible with closed testing in adaptive designs.
27019516|a|UNASSIGNED: We describe a general method for finding a confidence region for a parameter vector that is compatible with the decisions of a two-stage closed test procedure in an adaptive experiment. The closed test procedure is characterized by the fact that rejection or nonrejection of a null hypothesis may depend on the decisions for other hypotheses and the compatible confidence region will, in general, have a complex, nonrectangular shape. We find the smallest cross-product of simultaneous confidence intervals containing the region and provide computational shortcuts for calculating the lower bounds on parameters corresponding to the rejected null hypotheses. We illustrate the method with an adaptive phase II/III clinical trial.

27098668|t|Olfactory dysfunction is related to postoperative delirium in Parkinson's disease.
27098668|a|UNASSIGNED: Operations often lead to delirium in elderly patients, particularly those with impaired cognition, suggesting that underlying neuropathology may play a role in the development of postoperative delirium. Olfactory dysfunction is a well-known marker of underlying Lewy body pathology in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the prognostic value of olfaction for the development of postoperative delirium in PD remains unclear. 34 PD patients with or without postoperative delirium following surgery under general anesthesia were included in this study (n  =  17 for each group). Cross-Cultural Smell Identification scores were lower in PD patients with postoperative delirium (4.4      1.5) relative to the delirium-free controls (6.8      2.4, p  <  0.005). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that olfaction and operation time were significant predictors of the development of postoperative delirium. Impaired olfaction is significantly associated with postoperative delirium in PD. Olfaction may be useful for identifying PD patients susceptible to postoperative delirium.

27066465|t|Pathology of Podocytopathies Causing Nephrotic Syndrome in Children.
27066465|a|Nephrotic syndrome (NS) in children includes a diverse group of diseases that range from genetic diseases without any immunological defects to causes that are primarily due to immunological effects. Recent advances in molecular and genomic studies have resulted in a plethora of genetic defects that have been localized to the podocyte, the basic structure that is instrumental in normal filtration process. Although the disease can manifest from birth and into adulthood, the primary focus of this review would be to describe the novel genes and pathology of primary podocyte defects that cause NS in children. This review will restrict itself to the pathology of congenital NS, minimal change disease (MCD), and its variants and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The two major types of congenital NS are Finnish type characterized by dilated sausage shaped tubules morphologically and diffuse mesangial sclerosis characterized by glomerulosclerosis. MCD has usually normal appearing biopsy features on light microscopy and needs electron microscopy for diagnosis, whereas FSGS in contrast has classic segmental sclerosing lesions identified in different portions of the glomeruli and tubular atrophy. This review summarizes the pathological characteristics of these conditions and also delves into the various genetic defects that have been described as the cause of these primary podocytopathies. Other secondary causes of NS in children, such as membranoproliferative and membranous glomerulonephritis, will not be covered in this review.

27096198|t|Blood Eosinophils and World Trade Center Exposure Predict Surgery in Chronic Rhinosinusitis: A 13.5-Year Longitudinal Study.
27096198|a|RATIONALE: The World Trade Center (WTC) collapse generated caustic airborne particulates that caused chronic rhinosinusitis in exposed fire department of New York (FDNY) firefighters. Surgery was performed when symptoms remained uncontrolled despite medical management. OBJECTIVES: To identify predictors of surgical intervention for chronic rhinosinusitis in firefighters exposed to airborne irritants at the WTC collapse site. METHODS: We assessed in 8,227 firefighters with WTC-exposure between 9/11/2001 (9/11) and 9/25/2001, including WTC-site arrival time, months of rescue/recovery work, and eosinophil concentration measured between 9/11 and 3/10/2003. We assessed the association of serum cytokines and immunoglobulins with eosinophil concentration and surgery for rhinosinusitis in 112 surgical cases and 376 controls with serum available from the first 6 months after exposure to the WTC collapse site. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Between 9/11 and 3/10/2015, the surgery rate was 0.47 cases per 100 person years. In the first 18 months post 9/11, surgical patients had higher mean blood eosinophil levels than study cohort patients(219  155 vs. 191  134; P <0.0001). Increased surgery risk was associated with increasing blood eosinophil counts (HR 1.12 per 100 cells/uL; 95% CI 1.07 to1.17; P <0.001); arriving at the WTC site 9/11 or 9/12/2001 (HR 1.43; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.99; P=0.03); and working >= 6 months at the WTC-site (HR 1.48; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.93; P<0.01). Median blood eosinophil levels for surgery patients were above levels for the cohort in all 18-month intervals 3/11/2000 through 3/10/2015 using 51,163 measurements representing 97,733 person-years of observation. Increasing age, increasing IL-17A and low IgA in serum from 2001-2002 predicted blood eosinophil concentration in surgical patients but not in controls (R(2)=0.26, p<0.0001 vs. R(2)=0.008, p=0.56). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing blood eosinophil concentration predicts surgical intervention for chronic rhinosinusitis, particularly in those with intense acute and prolonged exposure to airborne irritants. WTC-exposed FDNY firefighters who underwent irritant-associated sinus surgery are immunologically different from the cohort. Surgical patients have a higher blood eosinophil levels that is associated with mediators of mucosal immunity.

27060981|t|Prostate tumour overexpressed-1 promotes tumourigenicity in human breast cancer via activation of Wnt/b-catenin signalling.
27060981|a|UNASSIGNED: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in females. The presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) is the main cause of local and distant tumour recurrence and is associated with poor outcome in breast cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance of CSCs remain largely unknown. This study demonstrates that prostate tumour overexpressed-1 (PTOV1) enhances the CSC population and augments the tumourigenicity of breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, PTOV1 suppresses transcription of Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) by recruiting histone deacetylases and subsequently reducing DKK1 promoter histone acetylation, followed by activation of Wnt/b-catenin signalling. Restoration of DKK1 expression in PTOV1-overexpressing cells counteracts the effects of PTOV1 on Wnt/b-catenin activation and the CSC population. Collectively, these results suggest that PTOV1 positively regulates the Wnt/b-catenin signalling pathway and enhances tumourigenicity in breast cancer; this novel mechanism may represent a therapeutic target for breast cancer.

27013580|t|Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) regulates autophagy through promoting the expression of Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) in human breast adenocarcinoma cells.
27013580|a|UNASSIGNED: FADD (Fas-associated protein with death domain) is a classical adaptor protein in apoptosis. Increasing evidences have shown that FADD is also implicated in cell cycle progression, proliferation and tumorigenesis. The role of FADD in cancer remains largely unexplored. In this study, In Silico Analysis using Oncomine and Kaplan Meier plotter revealed that FADD is significantly up-regulated in breast cancer tissues and closely associated with a poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. To better understanding the FADD functions in breast cancer, we performed proteomics analysis by LC-MS/MS detection and found that Rheb-mTORC1 pathway was dysregulated in MCF-7 cells when FADD knockdown. The mTORC1 pathway is a key regulator in many processes, including cell growth, metabolism and autophagy. Here, FADD interference down-regulated Rheb expression and repressed mTORC1 activity in breast cancer cell lines. The autophagy was induced by FADD deficiency in MCF7 or MDA-231 cells but rescued by recovering Rheb expression. Similarly, growth defect in FADD-knockdown cells was also restored by Rheb overexpression. These findings implied a novel role of FADD in tumor progression via Rheb-mTORC1 pathway in breast cancer.

27130679|t|Establishment of a new immortalized human corneal epithelial cell line (iHCE-NY1) for use in evaluating eye irritancy by in vitro test methods.
27130679|a|UNASSIGNED: In vitro test methods that use human corneal epithelial cells to evaluate the eye irritation potency of chemical substances do not use human corneal epithelium because it has been difficult to maintain more than four passages. In this study, we make a new cell line comprising immortalized human corneal epithelial cells (iHCE-NY1). The IC50 of iHCE-NY1 cells is slightly higher than that of Statens Seruminstitut Rabbit Cornea (SIRC) cells, which are currently used in some in vitro test methods. CDKN1A in iHCE-NY1 cells was used as a marker of gene expression to indicate cell cycle activity. This enabled us to evaluate cell recovery characteristics at concentrations lower than the IC50 of cytotoxic tests.

27130587|t|Critical access hospital ED to quaternary medical center: successful implementation of an integrated Picture Archiving and Communications System for patient transfers by air and sea.
27130587|a|PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of imaging in transfers between an island Critical Access Hospital (CAH) emergency department (ED) and a quaternary care hospital. METHODS: Electronic medical records were reviewed to identify all patients who were transferred from an island CAH to our quaternary care hospital in 2012 and 2013. Medical history, transfer diagnosis, and the type of imaging performed at the CAH prior to transfer were reviewed. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 22075 ED visits were made to the CAH and 696 (3.2%) of these patients were transferred for higher level of care, with 424 (60.9%) of the patients transferred to our quaternary care hospital. The most common reasons for transfer were cardiac (121; 28.5%), trauma (82; 19.3%), gastrointestinal (63; 14.9%), and neurologic conditions (54; 12.7%). Three hundred forty patients (80.2%) had imaging prior to transfer (56.4% radiograph, 33.5% computed tomography, 4.7% magnetic resonance imaging, 8.0% ultrasound). Of patients that had imaging, 53.6% had positive imaging findings related to the transfer diagnosis, and patients transferred for noncardiac etiologies were significantly more likely to have imaging findings related to their transfer diagnosis compared with patients transferred for cardiac etiologies (72.9% vs 6.9%, respectively; P< .0001). CONCLUSION: Approximately 3 of every 100 ED visits to the rural CAH required transfer for higher level of care, with nearly three-quarters of noncardiac transferred patients having a positive imaging finding related to the reason for transfer.

27130082|t|A new application of micellar liquid chromatography in the determination of free ampicillin concentration in the drug-human serum albumin standard solution in comparison with the adsorption method.
27130082|a|The determination of free drug concentration is a very important issue in the field of pharmacology because only the unbound drug fraction can achieve a pharmacological effect. Due to the ability to solubilize many different compounds in micellar aggregates, micellar liquid chromatography (MLC) can be used for direct determination of free drug concentration. Proteins are not retained on the stationary phase probably due to the formation of protein - surfactant complexes which are excluded from the pores of stationary phase. The micellar method is simple and fast. It does not require any pre-preparation of the tested samples for analysis. The main aim of this paper is to demonstrate a completely new applicability of the analytical use of MLC concerning the determination of free drug concentration in the standard solution of human serum albumin. The well-known adsorption method using RP-HPLC and the spectrophotometric technique was applied as the reference method. The results show that the free drug concentration value obtained in the MLC system (based on the RP-8 stationary phase and CTAB) is similar to that obtained by the adsorption method: both RP-HPLC (95.83 gmL(-1), 79.86% of free form) and spectrophotometry (95.71 gmL(-1), 79.76%). In the MLC the free drug concentration was 93.98 gmL(-1) (78.3%). This indicates that the obtained results are within the analytical range of % of free ampicillin fraction and the MLC with direct sample injection can be treated like a promising method for the determination of free drug concentration.

27155860|t|Treatment Options for Narcolepsy.
27155860|a|UNASSIGNED: Narcolepsy type 1 and narcolepsy type 2 are central disorders of hypersomnolence. Narcolepsy type 1 is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy and is associated with hypocretin-1 deficiency. On the other hand, in narcolepsy type 2, cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels are normal and cataplexy absent. Despite major advances in our understanding of narcolepsy mechanisms, its current management is only symptomatic. Treatment options may vary from a single drug that targets several symptoms, or multiple medications that each treats a specific symptom. In recent years, narcolepsy treatment has changed with the widespread use of modafinil/armodafinil for daytime sleepiness, antidepressants (selective serotonin and dual serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors) for cataplexy, and sodium oxybate for both symptoms. Other psychostimulants can also be used, such as methylphenidate, pitolisant and rarely amphetamines, as third-line therapy. Importantly, clinically relevant subjective and objective measures of daytime sleepiness are required to monitor the treatment efficacy and to provide guidance on whether the treatment goals are met. Associated symptoms and comorbid conditions, such as hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, disturbed nighttime sleep, unpleasant dreams, REM- and non REM-related parasomnias, depressive symptoms, overweight/obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea, should also be taken into account and managed, if required. In the near future, the efficacy of new wake-promoting drugs, anticataplectic agents, hypocretin replacement therapy and immunotherapy at the early stages of the disease should also be evaluated.

27157123|t|Orientation-and polarization-dependent optical properties of the single Ag nanowire/glass substrate system excited by the evanescent wave.
27157123|a|As an important plasmon one-dimensional material, orientation- and polarization-dependent properties of single Ag nanowires/glass substrate system are investigated by a powerful platform consisting of evanescent wave excitation, near-/far-field detection and a micromanipulator. In the case of the nanowire perpendicular or parallel to the incident plane and p- ors-polarized evanescent excitation respectively, optical properties of the nanowire is measured both in far-field and near-field. For the perpendicular situation, scattering light from the nanowire shows strong dependence on the polarization of incident light, and period patterns along the nanowire are observed both in the near- and far-field. The chain of dipole model is used to explain the origin of this pattern. The discrepancy of the period patterns observed in the near- and far-field is due to the different resolution of the near- and far-field detection. For the parallel case, light intensity from the output end also depends on the incident polarization. Both experimental and calculation results show that the polarization dependence effect results from the surface plasmon excitation. These results on the orientation- and polarization-dependent properties of the Ag nanowires detected by the combination of near- and far-field methods would be helpful to understand interactions of one-dimensional plasmonic nanostructures with light.

27157529|t|Microscopic Structure of Contact Ion Pairs in Concentrated LiCl- and LiClO4-Tetrahydrofuran Solutions Studied by Low-Frequency Isotropic Raman Scattering and Neutron Diffraction with (6)Li/(7)Li Isotopic Substitution Methods.
27157529|a|UNASSIGNED: Low-frequency isotropic Raman scattering and time-of-flight neutron diffraction measurements were carried out for 6Li/7Li and H/D isotopically substituted *LiCl- and *LiClO4-tetrahydrofuran (*THF) solutions in order to obtain microscopic insight into solvated Li+, Li+   Cl- and Li+   ClO4- contact ion pairs formed in concentrated THF solutions. Symmetrical stretching vibrational mode of solvated Li+ in LiCl- and LiClO4 solutions was observed at     = 181~184 and 140 cm-1, respectively. The stretching vibrational mode of Li+   Cl- and Li+   ClO4- solvated contact ion pairs formed in 4 mol% 6LiCl-THF-h8 and 7LiCl-THF-h8 solutions was found at     = 469 and 435 cm-1, respectively. Detailed structural properties of solvated Li+ and the contact ion pairs were derived from the least squares fitting analyses of the first-order difference function,    Li(Q), obtained from neutron diffraction measurements on 6Li/7Li isotopically substituted THF-d8 solutions. It has been revealed that Li+ takes four-fold coordination in the average local structure of Li+X-(THF)3, X = Cl and ClO4. The nearest neighbor Li+   O(THF) distance was determined to be 2.21    0.01    and 2.07    0.01    for 4 mol% *LiCl- and 10 mol % *LiClO4-THF-d8 solutions, respectively. The Li+   anion distances for Li+   Cl- and Li+   O(ClO4-) contact ion pairs were determined to 2.4    0.1    and 2.19    0.01   , respectively. The nearest neighbor Li+   THF interaction is significantly modified by anion in the first solvation shell.

27048822|t|Mechanisms of ferroptosis.
27048822|a|UNASSIGNED: Ferroptosis is a non-apoptotic form of cell death that can be triggered by small molecules or conditions that inhibit glutathione biosynthesis or the glutathione-dependent antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). This lethal process is defined by the iron-dependent accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species and depletion of plasma membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids. Cancer cells with high level RAS-RAF-MEK pathway activity or p53 expression may be sensitized to this process. Conversely, a number of small molecule inhibitors of ferroptosis have been identified, including ferrostatin-1 and liproxstatin-1, which can block pathological cell death events in brain, kidney and other tissues. Recent work has identified a number of genes required for ferroptosis, including those involved in lipid and amino acid metabolism. Outstanding questions include the relationship between ferroptosis and other forms of cell death, and whether activation or inhibition of ferroptosis can be exploited to achieve desirable therapeutic ends.

27030258|t|Incidence of esophageal cancer in Sri Lanka: Analysis of cancer registry data and comparison with other South Asian populations.
27030258|a|INTRODUCTION: The objectives of this study were to report the incidence of Carcinoma of Esophagus (CaE) in Sri Lanka and to compare these values with other cancer registry data of the region and with migrant populations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared the data published by the National Cancer Control Program over the last two decades with data from the National Cancer Registry Programme of the Indian Council of Medical Research and Karachi Cancer Registry. SEERstat was used to analyze the surveillance, epidemiology and end results database to analyze data on Indian migrant population. RESULTS: CaE was the fourth most common cancer overall and among females and third most common cancer among males. The incidence of CaE rises with age in both sexes, with a peak in the 70-74 year age group. There was a disproportionately higher number of CaE in the Tamil population (chi-square test, P < 0.00001). The commonest type of CaE in Sri Lanka was squamous cell carcinoma, Not otherwise specified (NOS) (n = 750, 70.5%), followed by adenocarcinoma, NOS (n = 83, 7.8%). India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have comparable age-adjusted incidence and age distribution of CaE. All migrant populations had lower incidence of CaE than original population or population in their present country. Both cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption are more prevalent in Sri Lankan males than females. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of CaE and its distribution among age groups in Sri Lanka was comparable to other countries of the region. Persons of Tamil ethnicity have a higher risk of developing CaE.

27098539|t|Adjuvant I-131 Lipiodol After Resection or Radiofrequency Ablation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
27098539|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: High rates of recurrence have been observed after curative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The main aim of this study was to establish the influence of adjuvant transarterial radioembolization-based I-131 lipiodol on survival and recurrence. METHODS: Between 2004 and 2010, 38 patients were treated with adjuvant I-131 lipiodol therapy, at a dosage of 2220  MBq, within 4  months after surgery. This treated cohort was compared to a control cohort consisting of 42 consecutive patients operated prior to the time the I-131 lipiodol treatment became available. RESULTS: Recurrence-free survival in the control and in the I-131 lipiodol cohort was 12.6 and 18.7  months, respectively (HR  =  1.871, p  =  0.025). At 2 and 5  years, the cumulative incidence of a first recurrence or death was, respectively, 50  % and 61  % in the treated cohort versus 69  % and 74  % in the control cohort. Median overall survival was 55 and 29  months, respectively (p  =  0.051). Among patients with a recurrence at 2  years, more patients had already experienced such recurrence at 1  year in the control cohort (70  % vs 33  %, p  =  0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant I-131 lipiodol improves disease-free survival in patients with HCC.

27158534|t|Barrett's esophagus in 2016: From pathophysiology to treatment.
27158534|a|Esophageal complications caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) include reflux esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus (BE). BE is a premalignant condition with an increased risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). The carcinogenic sequence may progress through several steps, from normal esophageal mucosa through BE to EAC. A recent advent of functional esophageal testing (particularly multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH monitoring) has helped to improve our knowledge about GERD pathophysiology, including its complications. Those findings (when properly confirmed) might help to predict BE neoplastic progression. Over the last few decades, the incidence of EAC has continued to rise in Western populations. However, only a minority of BE patients develop EAC, opening the debate regarding the cost-effectiveness of current screening/surveillance strategies. Thus, major efforts in clinical and research practice are focused on new methods for optimal risk assessment that can stratify BE patients at low or high risk of developing EAC, which should improve the cost effectiveness of screening/surveillance programs and consequently significantly affect health-care costs. Furthermore, the area of BE therapeutic management is rapidly evolving. Endoscopic eradication therapies have been shown to be effective, and new therapeutic options for BE and EAC have emerged. The aim of the present review article is to highlight the status of screening/surveillance programs and the current progress of BE therapy. Moreover, we discuss the recent introduction of novel esophageal pathophysiological exams that have improved the knowledge of the mechanisms linking GERD to BE.

27159017|t|An elastic second skin.
27159017|a|UNASSIGNED: We report the synthesis and application of an elastic, wearable crosslinked polymer layer (XPL) that mimics the properties of normal, youthful skin. XPL is made of a tunable polysiloxane-based material that can be engineered with specific elasticity, contractility, adhesion, tensile strength and occlusivity. XPL can be topically applied, rapidly curing at the skin interface without the need for heat- or light-mediated activation. In a pilot human study, we examined the performance of a prototype XPL that has a tensile modulus matching normal skin responses at low strain (<40%), and that withstands elongations exceeding 250%, elastically recoiling with minimal strain-energy loss on repeated deformation. The application of XPL to the herniated lower eyelid fat pads of 12 subjects resulted in an average 2-grade decrease in herniation appearance in a 5-point severity scale. The XPL platform may offer advanced solutions to compromised skin barrier function, pharmaceutical delivery and wound dressings.

27158335|t|DCAF4L2 promotes colorectal cancer invasion and metastasis via mediating degradation of NFkb negative regulator PPM1B.
27158335|a|DCAF4L2 is a member of WD-repeat proteins, which commonly serve as mediators of protein-protein interplay. In this study, we reported that elevated DCAF4L2 expression in human colorectal cancer (CRC) significantly correlated with a more advanced clinical stage as in lymphatic and distant metastasis. More importantly, elevated DCAF4L2 expression is an independent prognosis factor for survival. Genetic perturbations demonstrated that DCAF4L2 overexpression in CRC cells promoted cell migration and invasion, whereas knockdown of which had opposing effects. Moreover we discovered that DCAF4L2 overexpression could promote epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) through activating NFkB signal pathway. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that DCAF4L2 could form an E3 ligase complex with Cul4A and DDB1 thus mediated degradation of PPM1B, which has been reported to negatively regulate NFkB signaling. We identified PPM1B as a substrate of Cul4A-DDB1-DCAF4L2 E3 ligase complex, as knockdown of PPM1B abrogated shDCAF4L2 mediated inhibition of cell invasion in CRC cells. For further verification, DCAF4L2 expression inversely correlated with PPM1B expression in a cohort of 87 CRC patients. These findings may provide insight into the understanding of DCAF4L2 as a novel critical factor and a candidate target for CRC treatment.

27015387|t|Validity of Consumer-Based Physical Activity Monitors for Specific Activity Types.
27015387|a|PURPOSE: Consumer-based physical activity (PA) monitors are popular for individual tracking of PA variables. However, current research has not examined how these monitors track energy expenditure (EE) and steps in distinct activities. This study examined the accuracy of the Fitbits One, Zip, and Flex and Jawbone UP24 for estimating EE and steps for specific activities and activity categories. METHODS: Thirty subjects completed a structured protocol consisting of three sedentary, four household, and four ambulatory/exercise activities. All subjects began by lying on a bed for 10 min; 10 other activities were performed for 5 min each. Indirect calorimetry (COSMED) and researcher-counted steps were criterion measures for EE and step counts, respectively. The Omron HJ-720IT pedometer was used as a comparison of step count accuracy. EE and steps were compared to criterion measures using the Friedman repeated-measures nonparametric test and mean absolute percent error (MAPE). RESULTS: All PA monitors predicted EE within 8% of COSMED for sedentary activity but overestimated EE by 16-40% during ambulatory activity. All monitors except the Fitbit Flex (within 8% of criterion) underestimated EE by 27-34% during household activity. EE predictions were accompanied with MAPE >10%. For household activity, the Fitbit Flex estimated steps within 10% of researcher-counted steps; all other monitors underestimated steps by 35-64%. All monitors estimated steps within 4% of researcher-counted steps and displayed MAPE <10% during ambulatory activity. The Omron underestimated household steps by 74% but was within 1% for ambulatory steps. All monitors severely underestimated EE and steps during cycling. CONCLUSION: Consumer-based PA monitors should be used cautiously for estimating EE, although they provide accurate measures of steps for structured ambulatory activity, similar to validated pedometers.

27012637|t|Transportal femoral drilling creates more horizontal ACL graft orientation compared to transtibial drilling: A 3D CT imaging study.
27012637|a|BACKGROUND: The principle of anatomic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is to create a femoral and tibial tunnel that resembles the insertion of the native ACL. Anatomic reconstruction leads to a more horizontal graft orientation that provides more rotational stability. The aim of this study is to investigate the best method to achieve anatomical reconstruction of femoral insertion of the ACL and thus, a more horizontal orientation of the ACL. We compared tunnel position and orientation between transportal femoral drilling technique and transtibial technique. METHODS: Thirty-two patients were included. Post-operative CT scans were obtained and femur, tibia and ACL tunnels were reconstructed. The position and orientation of tibial and femoral tunnels were quantified using the quadrant method, and femoral tunnel length, ellipticity and posterior wall breakage were assessed. We also investigated clinical outcome. RESULTS: Analyses show that transportal drilled femoral tunnels were situated significantly lower than transtibial drilled tunnels (p<0.0001), resulting in a significantly more horizontal oriented ACL in the transportal group in coronal (p<0.0001) and sagittal plane (p=0.01). No differences were observed in depth of femoral tunnel position (p=0.44). Femoral tunnel length was shorter in the transportal group (p=0.01) with a more ellipsoidal femoral aperture (p=0.01). There were no differences between both groups in tibial position. There were no differences in clinical outcome measure between the transportal and transtibial groups. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that transportal drilling of the femoral tunnel leads to a more horizontal graft orientation of the ACL, without differences in clinical outcome.

27009720|t|NONPHOSPHORUS LIPIDS IN PERIPHYTON REFLECT AVAILABLE NUTRIENTS IN THE FLORIDA EVERGLADES, USA(1).
27009720|a|Algal and plant production of nonphosphorus lipids in place of phospholipids is a physiological response to low phosphorus (P) availability. This response has been shown in culture and in marine plankton studies, but examples from freshwater algae remain minimal. Herein, we analyzed the nutrient contents and lipid composition of periphyton communities across the Florida Everglades ecosystem. We hypothesized that in phosphate-poor areas, periphyton in high- and low-sulfate waters would vary the proportion of sulfolipids (SLs) and betaine lipids (BLs), respectively. In phosphate-enriched areas, periphyton would produce more phospholipids (PLs). We observed that at low-P sites, PLs were a minor lipid component. In cyanobacteria-dominated periphyton where sulfate was abundant, BLs were only slightly more abundant than SLs. However, in the low-P, low-sulfate area, periphyton were comprised to a greater degree green algae and diatoms, and BLs represented the majority of the total lipids. Even in a P-rich area, PLs were a small component of periphyton lipid profiles. Despite the phosphorus limitations of the Everglades, periphyton can develop tremendous biomass. Our results suggest a physiological response by periphyton to oligotrophic conditions whereby periphyton increase abundances of nonphosphorus lipids and have reduced proportions of PLs.

27011971|t|[Characteristics and Resources of Fly Ash Particles in the Snowpack of Jinfo Mountain, Chongqing].
27011971|a|Snow can preserve the atmospheric information, which makes it become a good media in studying regional environment. Jinfo Mountain with an elevation of 2251.1 m, located at the transition zone between Sichuan basin and Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, is deeply affected by human activities, and snowfall is the main form of precipitation during the winter. While the literature focus on single spherical particles in this area is uncommon. Five snow samples were collected, and determined morphology and chemical composition of 132 single spherical particles by the scanning electron microscope couples with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (SEM-EDS). Results show that snowfall in Jinfo Mountain includes the massive fly ash particles with 1.64   m in average diameter and 1.09 in average roundness which contains smooth particles, rough particles and soot particles, accounting for 80. 31% , 14. 39% and 5.30% of statistical particles respectively. Furthermore, on the basis of chemical information obtained from EDS, the fly ash particles counted in this research can be classified into 5 types, namely, Si-dominant particles, C-dominant particles, Fe-dominant particles, Al-dominant particles and Ti-dominant particles, which make up 34.09%, 49.24%, 12.88%, 2.27% and 1.52% respectively. In conclusion, it can be inferred, based on the analysis of meteorological information, the properties of fly ash particles, and backward air mass trajectory and dispersion analysis, that C-dominant fly ash mainly comes from daily life and industry activities, Si-dominant fly ash particles may originate from the plant industry located in west Chingqing, north of Guizhou province, central of Hunan province, Zhejiang province, Jiangxi province and the west of Guangdong province, while the activities of foundry and iron or steel plants in the west of Chongqing, the north of Guizhou province and the central of Hunan province may be the main sources of Fe-dominant fly ash particles in our samples.

27030999|t|Self-oscillating Gel Accelerated while Sensing the Shape of an Aqueous Surface.
27030999|a|UNASSIGNED: The reciprocating motion of a self-oscillating square gel induced by the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction was investigated on an aqueous surface. The chemical wave propagated from the side at which the oxidation of the Ru catalyst in the gel started. As the chemical wave propagated, the gel moved in either the opposite (mode I) or the same (mode II) direction as the chemical wave propagation. The gel then went back as the Ru catalyst in the gel was slowly reduced. We examined the relationship between the modes of motion (mode I or II) and the shape of the aqueous BZ solution surface. The mode selection was discussed in relation to the contact angle around the gel which was changed by the BZ reaction, i.e., the lateral imbalance of surface tension and the capillary interaction.

27064652|t|Respiratory mechanics measured by forced oscillation technique in rheumatoid arthritis-related pulmonary abnormalities: frequency-dependence, heterogeneity and effects of smoking.
27064652|a|Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-related pulmonary disorders specifically airway abnormalities and interstitial pneumonia (IP) are important extra-articular manifestations. The forced oscillation technique (FOT) is a useful method to assess respiratory impedance, respiratory resistance (Rrs) and reactance (Xrs), at different oscillatory frequencies during tidal breathing. The aim of this study was to characterize the respiratory mechanics of patients with RA and to relate them to parameters of the pulmonary function test and findings of chest CT images. Respiratory impedance of RA patients (n  =  69) was measured as a function of frequency from 4 to 36  Hz using the FOT device and compared with that of healthy subjects (n  =  10). Data were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were female-dominant (60.9  %) and 95.7  % had abnormal CT findings including airway and parenchymal abnormalities. Thirty-seven of 69 patients (53.6  %) were smokers. Rrs was significantly frequency-dependent in RA patients but not in the healthy subjects. Xrs were significantly frequency-dependent in both RA and healthy groups. Rrs was significantly higher during an expiratory phase in both RA and healthy groups. Xrs was significantly lower (more negative) during an expiratory phase than that during an inspiratory phase in RA patients but not in healthy subjects. Xrs of the RA group was significantly more negative than that of the normal control. There was no difference in impedance parameters between the airway lesion dominant (n  =  27) and IP dominant groups (n  =  23) in the RA group. The impedance parameters of the RA group significantly correlated with most parameters of the pulmonary function test. In pulmonary function test results, % of the predicted value for forced expiratory flow from 25 to 75  % of forced vital capacity was significantly lower and % of the predicted value for diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide was higher in the airway lesion dominant group than those in the IP dominant group. Krebs von den Lungen-6, a serum indicator of IP, was significantly higher in the IP group than that in the airway lesion dominant group. Taken together, the impedance results reflect abnormalities in pulmonary functions and structures in patients with RA.

27079225|t|Herbal Acupuncture for the Treatment of  Obesity.
27079225|a|Obesity is the state of excessive body fat accumulation and is mainly caused by consuming more calories than are burned through physical activity. Herbal acupuncture (HA), also known as pharmacopuncture, has been increasingly used in clinics of Korean medical to alleviate obesity. This review analyzed four clinical studies and 16 animal studies on the effectiveness of HA as a treatment for obesity. Clinical evidence suggests that various kinds of HA might be beneficial for treating obesity; however, further investigations with well-designed, evidence-based, randomized clinical trials are needed. Animal studies support the idea that HA might be beneficial for the treatment of obesity and provide possible mechanisms, such as anti-inflammation, antioxidation, modulating lipid metabolism and so on, to explain the effect of HA on obesity. This review, based on the evidence collected, suggests that HA could have a beneficial effect for alleviating obesity by modulating inflammation, oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, leptin, and the insulin signal.

27079084|t|[Comparative Study on the Three Algorithms of T-wave End Detection: Wavelet Method, Cumulative Points Area Method and Trapezium Area Method].
27079084|a|In order to find the most suitable algorithm of T-wave end point detection for clinical detection, we tested three methods, which are not just dependent on the threshold value of T-wave end point detection, i. e. wavelet method, cumulative point area method and trapezium area method, in PhysioNet QT database (20 records with 3 569 beats each). We analyzed and compared their detection performance. First, we used the wavelet method to locate the QRS complex and T-wave. Then we divided the T-wave into four morphologies, and we used the three algorithms mentioned above to detect T-wave end point. Finally, we proposed an adaptive selection T-wave end point detection algorithm based on T-wave morphology and tested it with experiments. The results showed that this adaptive selection method had better detection performance than that of the single T-wave end point detection algorithm. The sensitivity, positive predictive value and the average time errors were 98.93%, 99.11% and (--2.33    19.70) ms, respectively. Consequently, it can be concluded that the adaptive selection algorithm based on T-wave morphology improves the efficiency of T-wave end point detection.

27008703|t|MiR-128-2 inhibits common lymphoid progenitors from developing into progenitor B cells.
27008703|a|UNASSIGNED: A considerable number of studies revealed that B cell development is finely regulated by transcription factors (TFs). Recent studies suggested that TFs are coordinated with microRNAs to control the development of B cells in numerous checkpoints. In the present study, we first found that miR-128-2 was differentially expressed in various immune organs and immunocytes. B cell development was inhibited in miR-128-2-overexpressed chimera and transgenic (TG) mice in bone marrow with decreased preproB, preB, proB, immature B, and recirculating B cells, as well as increased common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs). Further experiments showed that the apoptosis of CLP decreased, but proliferation was not altered in miR-128-2-overexpressed mice. Extensive studies suggested that the inhibition of apoptosis of CLP may be caused by miR-128-2 targeting A2B and MALT1, thereby increasing the phosphorylation of ERK and P38 MAPK. Such findings have prompted future investigations on the function of miR-128-2 in lymph genesis.

27004119|t|The effect of encapsulated fennel extracts on the quality of silver carp fillets during refrigerated storage.
27004119|a|The effect of fennel extract on the quality of silver carp (Hypophthalmicthys molitrix) fillets, and the possible efficacy of liposomal encapsulation in the improvement of its antimicrobial and antioxidant activity during chilled storage (4  +  1  C) of the fillets were examined over a period of 15  days. Silver carp fillets were treated with pure fennel extract (0.3% and 0.5% w/v) and liposomal encapsulated fennel extract (0.3% and 0.5% w/v), and their quality changes in terms of total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), peroxide value (PV), thiobarbituric acid (TBA), microbial counts, and sensory properties were investigated. Fennel extract could retard the deterioration of silver carp fillets, as reflected in lower TVB-N, PV and TBA value. Moreover, the efficacy of fennel extract was improved when it was encapsulated into liposome. Silver carp fillets treated with the encapsulated fennel extract showed the lowest amount of lipid oxidation and microbial deterioration during the storage period compared with the control and pure extract treatments. Sensory evaluation revealed that shelf life of silver carp fillet was longest for samples treated with encapsulated fennel extract at 0.5% (15  days), as compared to the control (6  days) (P  <  0.05).

27094812|t|miR-200c: a versatile watchdog in cancer progression, EMT, and drug resistance.
27094812|a|UNASSIGNED: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 20-22-nucleotide small endogenous non-coding RNAs which regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level. In the last two decades, identification of almost 2600 miRNAs in human and their potential to be modulated opened a new avenue to target almost all hallmarks of cancer. miRNAs have been classified as tumor suppressors or oncogenes depending on the phenotype they induce, the targets they modulate, and the tissue where they function. miR-200c, an illustrious tumor suppressor, is one of the highly studied miRNAs in terms of development, stemness, proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), therapy resistance, and metastasis. In this review, we first focus on the regulation of miR-200c expression and its role in regulating EMT in a ZEB1/E-cadherin axis-dependent and ZEB1/E-cadherin axis-independent manner. We then describe the role of miR-200c in therapy resistance in terms of multidrug resistance, chemoresistance, targeted therapy resistance, and radiotherapy resistance in various cancer types. We highlight the importance of miR-200c at the intersection of EMT and chemoresistance. Furthermore, we show how miR-200c coordinates several important signaling cascades such as TGF-b signaling, PI3K/Akt signaling, Notch signaling, VEGF signaling, and NF-kB signaling. Finally, we discuss miR-200c as a potential prognostic/diagnostic biomarker in several diseases, but mainly focusing on cancer and its potential application in future therapeutics.

27049648|t|Effect of noise on comfort in open-plan offices: application of an assessment questionnaire.
27049648|a|UNASSIGNED: Open-plan offices account for 60% of French office workspaces. The noise levels recorded in this type of environment are much lower than those encountered in industrial workplaces. Nevertheless, surveys show that noise is considered by employees as the main source of discomfort. A first questionnaire dedicated to noise discomfort was produced in 2013 and tested on a panel made up of 217 people working in 7 French companies. Today, it also makes it possible to address the issues of fatigue related to ambient sound, but above all, the survey aims to study the differences in how ambient noise is perceived depending on the type of open-plan office. On the basis of that new version, a second survey has been conducted in 23 open-plan offices, making it possible to collect the responses from 617 employees. Most of the results of the first survey have been confirmed, with an increase in the significance of the statistical analyses. Moreover, French Standard NF  S 31-199, which is currently being drafted, establishes a typology of open-plan office spaces according to the types of work done in them. Based on this typology, it appears that when dealing with the impact on noise on workers, a distinction has to be made between the types of open plan offices. Practitioner Summary Surveys conducted in open-plan offices show that noise is considered by employees as the main source of discomfort even if the noise recorded in this type of environment is not hazardous. This work presents the result of a large survey dedicated to noise discomfort conducted in 23 open-plan offices.

27074565|t|STAT3 and NF-kB cooperatively control in vitro spontaneous apoptosis and poor chemo-responsiveness in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
27074565|a|UNASSIGNED: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an adult disease characterized by in vivo accumulation of mature CD5/CD19/CD23 triple positive B cells and is currently incurable. CLL cells undergo spontaneous apoptosis in response to in vitro cell culture condition but the underlying mechanism is unclear. We hypothesize that the sensitivity of CLL cells to spontaneous apoptosis may be associated with the constitutive activities of transcription factors STAT3 and/or NF-kB. We now show that the sensitivity of fresh CLL cells to spontaneous apoptosis is highly variable among different patients during 48 hours' cell culture and inversely correlated with in vivo constitutively activated STAT3 and NF-kB (p < 0.001). Both activated STAT3 and NF-kB maintain the levels of anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1/Bcl-xL and autocrine IL-6 production. CLL cells with higher susceptibility to in vitro spontaneous apoptosis show the greatest chemosensitivity (p < 0.001), which is reflected clinically as achieving a complete response (CR) (p < 0.001), longer lymphocyte doubling times (p < 0.01), time to first treatment (p < 0.01), and progression free survival (p < 0.05). Our data suggest that the sensitivity of CLL cells to in vitro spontaneous apoptosis is co-regulated by constitutively activated STAT3 and NF-kB and reflects the in vivo chemo-responsiveness and clinical outcomes.

27089158|t|Glutamine supplementation to prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants.
27089158|a|BACKGROUND: Glutamine is a conditionally essential amino acid. Endogenous biosynthesis may be insufficient for tissue needs in states of metabolic stress. Evidence exists that glutamine supplementation improves clinical outcomes in critically ill adults. It has been suggested that glutamine supplementation may also benefit preterm infants. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of glutamine supplementation on mortality and morbidity in preterm infants. SEARCH METHODS: We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. This included searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2015, Issue 12), MEDLINE, EMBASE and Maternity and Infant Care (to December 2015), conference proceedings and previous reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared glutamine supplementation versus no glutamine supplementation in preterm infants at any time from birth to discharge from hospital. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data using the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group, with separate evaluation of trial quality and data extraction by two review authors. We synthesised data using a fixed-effect model and reported typical relative risk, typical risk difference and weighted mean difference. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 12 randomised controlled trials in which a total of 2877 preterm infants participated. Six trials assessed enteral glutamine supplementation and six trials assessed parenteral glutamine supplementation. The trials were generally of good methodological quality. Meta-analysis did not find an effect of glutamine supplementation on mortality (typical relative risk 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.80 to 1.17; risk difference 0.00, 95% confidence interval -0.03 to 0.02) or major neonatal morbidities including the incidence of invasive infection or necrotising enterocolitis. Three trials that assessed neurodevelopmental outcomes in children aged 18 to 24 months and beyond did not find any effects. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The available trial data do not provide evidence that glutamine supplementation confers important benefits for preterm infants.

27103435|t|Enhanced direct conversion of fibroblasts into hepatocyte-like cells by Kdm2b.
27103435|a|UNASSIGNED: Cell fate conversion of terminally differentiated cells by defined transcription factors between different lineages is a new approach to produce new cells that have the capability to repair or replace diseased and damaged tissues. Previous studies have demonstrated that this inefficient process can be facilitated by the inclusion of additional factors. Here we report that Kdm2b, a histone demethylase, has the capability to promote conversion of fibroblasts to functional induced hepatocyte-like (iHep) cells in combination with previously reported hepatic lineage transcription factors, Hnf4a and Foxa3. This approach led to increased numbers of epithelial-like colonies, hepatic markers and functionality which included periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) positive colonies, CYP450 activity, low-density lipoprotein and indocyanine green (ICG) uptake, as well as Albumin secretion. Additionally, the transplanted iHep cells were engraftable, expressed Albumin, and contributed to the recovery of a carbon tetrachloride-injured mouse model. These results have not only identified an important epigenetic factor for iHep generation, but also brought new insight into the molecular nature of hepatogenesis and future biomedical applications for liver diseases.

27133533|t|Prevalence and risk factors for central diabetes insipidus in cardiac arrest survivor treated with targeted temperature management.
27133533|a|PURPOSE: Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a marker of severe brain injury. Here we aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of CDI in cardiac arrest survivors treated with targeted temperature management (TTM). METHODS: This retrospective observational study included consecutive adult cardiac arrest survivors treated with TTM between 2008 and 2014. Central diabetes insipidus was confirmed if all of the following criteria were met: urine volume >50 cc kg(-1) d(-1), serum osmolarity >300 mmol/L, urine osmolarity <300 mmol/L, and serum sodium >145 mEq/L. The primary outcome was the incidence of CDI. RESULTS: Of the 385 included patients, 45 (11.7%) had confirmed central CDI. Univariate analysis showed that younger age, nonwitness of collapse, nonshockable rhythm, a high incidence of asphyxia arrest, longer downtime, and lower initial core temperature were associated with CDI development. Patients with CDI had a higher incidence of poor neurologic outcomes at discharge and higher in-hospital mortality rate (20/45 vs 76/340, P= .001) as well as 180-day mortality (44/45 vs 174/340, P< .001). Multivariate analysis revealed that age (odds ratio [OR], 0.963; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.942-0.984), shockable rhythm (OR, 0.077; 95% CI, 0.009-0.662), downtime (OR, 1.025; 95% CI, 1.006-1.044), and asphyxia etiology (OR, 6.815; 95% CI, 2.457-18.899) were independently associated with CDI development. CONCLUSION: Central diabetes insipidus developed in 12% of cardiac arrest survivors treated with TTM, and those with CDI showed poor neurologic outcomes and high mortality rates. Younger age, nonshockable rhythm, long downtime, and asphyxia arrest were significant risk factors for development of CDI.

27037477|t|The impact of functionalized CNT in the network of sodium alginate-based nanocomposite beads on the removal of Co(II) ions from aqueous solutions.
27037477|a|UNASSIGNED: Significant efforts have been made to develop highly efficient adsorbents to remove radioactive Co(II) ion pollutants from medical and industrial wastewaters. In this study, amide group functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotube (CNT-CONH2) imprinted in the network of sodium alginate containing hydroxyapatite, and new nanocomposite beads were synthesized. Then, they were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The prepared nanocomposite beads were used as an adsorbent of Co(II) ions from an aqueous solution. The presence and distribution of Co(II) ions in the surface of the nanocomposite beads was confirmed using FESEM, EDS and metal mapping analysis. The effect of various experimental conditions such as time, pH, and initial concentration of the adsorbate solution and temperature on the adsorption capacity of the nanocomposite beads were explored. The maximum Co(II) ions adsorption capacity of the prepared nanocomposite beads with the largest surface area of 163.4m(2)g(-1) was 347.8mgg(-1) in the optimized condition. The adsorption mechanism followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Furthermore, the Freundlich appears to produce better fit than the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Finally, thermodynamic studies suggest that endothermic adsorption process of Co(II) ions is spontaneous and thermodynamically favorable.

27075206|t|Nursing physical assessment for patient safety in general wards: reaching consensus on core skills.
27075206|a|AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To determine consensus across acute care specialty areas on core physical assessment skills necessary for early recognition of changes in patient status in general wards. BACKGROUND: Current approaches to physical assessment are inconsistent and have not evolved to meet increased patient and system demands. New models of nursing assessment are needed in general wards that ensure a proactive and patient safety approach. DESIGN: A modified Delphi study. METHODS: Focus group interviews with 150 acute care registered nurses at a large tertiary referral hospital generated a framework of core skills that were developed into a web-based survey. We then sought consensus with a panel of 35 senior acute care registered nurses following a classical Delphi approach over three rounds. Consensus was predefined as at least 80% agreement for each skill across specialty areas. RESULTS: Content analysis of focus group transcripts identified 40 discrete core physical assessment skills. In the Delphi rounds, 16 of these were consensus validated as core skills and were conceptually aligned with the primary survey: (Airway) Assess airway patency; (Breathing) Measure respiratory rate, Evaluate work of breathing, Measure oxygen saturation; (Circulation) Palpate pulse rate and rhythm, Measure blood pressure by auscultation, Assess urine output; (Disability) Assess level of consciousness, Evaluate speech, Assess for pain; (Exposure) Measure body temperature, Inspect skin integrity, Inspect and palpate skin for signs of pressure injury, Observe any wounds, dressings, drains and invasive lines, Observe ability to transfer and mobilise, Assess bowel movements. CONCLUSIONS: Among a large and diverse group of experienced acute care registered nurses consensus was achieved on a structured core physical assessment to detect early changes in patient status. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Although further research is needed to refine the model, clinical application should promote systematic assessment and clinical reasoning at the bedside.

27003063|t|Spatial and temporal variations of water quality in an artificial urban river receiving WWTP effluent in South China.
27003063|a|Urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent as reclaimed water provides an alternative water resource for urban rivers and effluent will pose a significant influence on the water quality of rivers. The objective of this study was to investigate the spatial and temporal variations of water quality in XZ River, an artificial urban river in Shenzhen city, Guangdong Province, China, after receiving reclaimed water from WWTP effluent. The water samples were collected monthly at different sites of XZ River from April 2013 to September 2014. Multivariate statistical techniques and a box-plot were used to assess the variations of water quality and to identify the main pollution factor. The results showed the input of WWTP effluent could effectively increase dissolved oxygen, decrease turbidity, phosphorus load and organic pollution load of XZ River. However, total nitrogen and nitrate pollution loads were found to remain at higher levels after receiving reclaimed water, which might aggravate eutrophication status of XZ River. Organic pollution load exhibited the lowest value on the 750 m downstream of XZ River, while turbidity and nutrient load showed the lowest values on the 2,300 m downstream. There was a higher load of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution in the dry season and at the beginning of wet season.

27004032|t|Synergistic Effects Induced by Combined Treatments of Aqueous Extract of Propolis and Venom.
27004032|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is considered to be one of the most aggressive breast neoplasia due to failure of chemotherapy response. Thus, there is an urgent need of finding alternative therapies for TNBC. This study was designed to evaluate the synergistic effect induced by propolis and bee venom on luminal (MCF-7) and TNBC (Hs578T) cell lines. METHODS: In order to evaluate the synergistic effect of aqueous extract of propolis and bee venom, we treated in combination two breast cancer cell lines: MCF-7(luminal subtype) and Hs578T (TNBC subtype). RESULTS: Our results indicate that both cell lines exhibited similar sensitivity to the aqueous extract of propolis at a dilution of 0.072-0.09 mg/ml. The results concerning IC50 for bee venom on MCF-7 cells was 1 mg/ml, 20 times higher than 0.05 mg/ml in Hs578T cells. By combining the aqueous extract of propolis with bee venom, we obtained synergistic effects at a higher concentration, which was 5 and 2 times stronger than the two treatments alone. CONCLUSION: Overall, the results from our study indicated that the combination of aqueous extract of propolis and bee venom treatments induced synergistic antiproliferative effects in a concentration-dependent manner in breast cancer cells. Thus we can hypothesize that the combination of honeybee propolis and venom might be involved in signaling pathways that could overcome cells resistance to therapy.

27007725|a|UNASSIGNED: Couples affect each other cognitively, emotionally and behaviorally. The goal of this study is to test the benefits and potential use of the actor-partner interdependence model in examining how parental self-efficacy and positive contributions of fathers and mothers of children with Autism Spectrum Condition influence each other's psychological adaptation. The sample includes 76 Spanish couples who completed validated questionnaires measuring predictors, i.e., self-efficacy and positive contributions, and adaptation outcomes i.e., stress, anxiety, depression and psychological well-being. Multilevel analysis revealed many actor and some partner effects of parental self-efficacy and positive contributions to be important determinants of adaptation above and beyond child and sociodemographic factors, and as such, these effects should be targeted in clinical intervention programs.

27008548|t|The long-term impact of team-based learning on medical students' team performance scores and on their peer evaluation scores.
27008548|a|BACKGROUND: The Faculty of Medicine at the American University of Beirut implemented a new medical curriculum, which included 90 team-based learning (TBL) sessions in years 1 and 2 of medical school. METHODS: A validated team performance scale (TPS) and peer evaluation of communication skills, professionalism and personal development were collected at different time points during the two years. Grades on the individual and group readiness assurance tests and an evaluation form were collected after every TBL session. RESULTS: Students generally positively evaluated most TBL sessions as promoters of critical thinking and appreciated the self-learning experience, though they preferred and had better individual grades on those that entailed preparation of didactic lectures. There was a sustained and cumulative improvement in teamwork skills over time. Similar improvement was noted with peer evaluations of communication skills, professionalism, and personal development over time. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report about such a longitudinal follow-up of medical students who were exposed to a large number of TBL sessions over two years. The results support the suggestion that TBL improves medical students' team dynamics and their perceived self-learning, problem solving and communication skills, as well as their professionalism and personal development.

27000848|t|Paternal Lifelong Socioeconomic Position and Low Birth Weight Rates: Relevance to the African-American Women's Birth Outcome Disadvantage.
27000848|a|UNASSIGNED: Objectives To determine the relation of paternal lifelong socioeconomic position (SEP) to the racial disparity in low birth weight (<2500  g, LBW) rates. Methods Stratified and multilevel logistic regression analyses were performed on an Illinois transgenerational dataset of infants (1989-1991) and their parents (1956-1976) with appended U.S. census income data. The neighborhood incomes of father's place of residence at the time of his birth and at the time of his infant's birth were used to measure of lifelong SEP. Population attributable risk (PAR) percentages were calculated to estimate the percentage of LBW infants attributable to paternal low SEP. Results In Cook County, infants (n  =  10,168) born to fathers with a lifelong high SEP had a LBW rate of 3.7  %. LBW rates rose among infants born to fathers with early-life (n  =  7224), adulthood (n  =  2913), or lifelong (n  =  7288) low SEP: 5.2, 6.9, and 9.3  %, respectively. The adjusted (controlling for maternal demographic characteristics) OR of LBW for fathers with an early-life, adulthood, or lifelong low (compared to lifelong high) SEP equaled 1.4 (1.2, 1.6), 1.5 (1.3, 1.9), and 2.0 (1.7, 2.3), respectively. The PAR percentages of LBW for paternal low SEP were 40 and 9  % among African-American and White mothers, respectively. Among fathers with a lifelong high SEP, the adjusted OR of LBW for African-American (compared to White) mothers was 1.1 (0.7, 1.7). Conclusions Low paternal SEP is a novel risk factor for infant LBW independent of maternal demographic characteristics. This phenomenon is particularly relevant to the African-American women's birth outcome disadvantage.

27125231|t|[Anterior knee pain after total knee arthroplasty : Causes, diagnosis and treatment].
27125231|a|BACKGROUND: Anterior knee pain is one of the most common complications after total knee arthroplasty. An incidence of up to 30   % has been reported in peer-reviewed studies. TARGET: The purpose of this study was to systematically review the literature and to identify determinants that have been analyzed with regard to anterior knee pain. CAUSES: Patient- and knee-specific characteristics, prosthetic designs and operative techniques are addressed as well as functional and neurologic determinants. Instability, increased contact pressure in the patellofemoral joint and patella maltracking due to malrotation of components, offset errors, ligament insufficiencies or patella baja are mechanical reasons for anterior knee pain. Functional causes include pathologic gait patterns, quadriceps imbalance and dynamic valgus. They have to be differentiated from infectious and inflammatory causes as well as soft tissue impingement, arthrofibrosis and neurologic diseases. TREATMENT: A  differentiated treatment algorithm is recommended. Often conservative treatment options exist, however, particularly with most mechanical causes revision surgery is necessary.

27169015|t|Villous Tumor of the Urinary Bladder Resembling Low-grade Mucinous Neoplasm of the Appendix.
27169015|a|UNASSIGNED: Mucinous neoplasms of the urinary tract are very rare. We present a 63-year-old-women who had a sessile papillary villous tumor in urinary bladder. Although transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) was performed, the villous tumor repetitively recurred and gradually spread to the entire surface of bladder lumen. Histopathologic and immunohistochemical examination showed that the lesion was very similar to low-grade mucinous neoplasm arising in appendix vermiformis. There are no reports on appendiceal metaplasia of urinary bladder mucosa. In this case, we describe this unprecedented neoplasm as "villous tumor of the urinary bladder resembling low-grade mucinous neoplasm of the appendix."

27069728|t|Modification of sleep-waking and electroencephalogram induced by vetiver essential oil inhalation.
27069728|a|BACKGROUND: Essential oils (EOs) have been claimed to modulate mental functions though the most of data were obtained from subjective methods of assessment. Direct effects of EO on brain function remained largely to be confirmed with scientific proof. This study aimed to demonstrate quantifiable and reproducible effects of commercial vetiver (Vetiveria zizanioides) EO inhalation on sleep-waking and electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns in adult male Wistar rats. The experiments were conducted during November 2013 - February 2014. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The following electrode implantation on the skull, control, and treated animals were subjected for EEG recording while inhaling water and vetiver EO (20 and 200   l), respectively. Fast Fourier transform was used for analysis of EEG power spectrum. RESULTS: One-way ANOVA analysis confirmed that vetiver EO inhalation significantly increased total waking and reduced slow-wave sleep time. Moreover, EO inhalation decreased alpha and beta1 activity in both frontal and parietal cortices and increased gamma activity in the frontal cortex. Changes in these frequencies began almost from the start of the inhalation. CONCLUSION: These data suggest refreshing properties of vetiver EO on electrical brain activity and alertness.

27016219|t|Gender Differences in the Factors Explaining Risky Behavior Online.
27016219|a|UNASSIGNED: In searching for the social and cognitive antecedents of risky online behaviors, some studies have relied on the theory of planned behavior. According to the theory, three components serve as predictors of a given behavior-attitudes toward the behavior (beliefs that people hold about a given behavior), subjective norms (perceptions of what significant others think about the behavior) and perceived behavior control (perceptions about the ease or difficulty of engaging in a particular behavior). However, none of these studies considered the possibility that these factors work differently for boys and girls. We constructed models of the possible antecedents (attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavior control) of risky behavior online and tested them using a representative sample of 495 sixth to eleventh grade students (46  % female) in a large city in Israel. We measured risky behavior online with items indicating the frequency of posting personal details, sending an insulting message and meeting face-to-face with a stranger met online. Structural equation modeling revealed that peers' subjective norms (beliefs that friends approve of engaging in risky online behaviors), parents' subjective norms (beliefs that parents accept involvement in risky online behaviors) and perceived behavior control were related to boys' risky behavior online, whereas for girls, only parents' subjective norms had such an association. Expanding the models to include other factors underscored that family factors were most strongly associated with girls' risky behavior online.

27006203|t|Helical Nano-crystallite (HNC) Phases: Chirality Synchronization of Achiral Bent-Core Mesogens in a New Type of Dark Conglomerates.
27006203|a|UNASSIGNED: Spontaneous generation of macroscopic homochirality in soft matter systems by self-assembly of exclusively achiral molecules under achiral conditions is a challenging task with relevance for fundamental scientific research and technological applications. Dark conglomerate phases (DC phases), being optically isotropic mesophases composed of conglomerates of macroscopic chiral domains and formed by some non-chiral bent-core mesogens, represent such a case. Here we report two new series of non-symmetric bent-core molecules capable of forming a new type of mirror symmetry broken DC phases. In the synthesized molecules, a bent 4-bromoresorcinol core is connected to a phenyl benzoate wing and an azobenzene wing with or without additional peripheral fluorine substitution. The self-assembly was investigated by DSC, polarizing microscopy, electro-optical studies and XRD. Chiral and apparently achiral DC phases were observed besides distinct types of lamellar liquid crystalline phases with different degree of polar order, allowing the investigation of the transition from smectic to DC phases. This indicates a process in which increased packing density at first gives rise to restricted rotation and thus to growing polar order, which then leads to chirality synchronization, layer frustration and nano-scale crystallization. Topological constraints arising from the twisted packing of helical conformers in lamellar crystals is proposed to lead to amorphous solids composed of helical nano-crystallites with short coherence length (HNC phases). This is considered as a third major type of DC phases, distinct from the previously known liquid crystalline sponge phases and the helical nano-filament phases (HNF phases). Guidelines for the molecular design of new materials capable of self-assembly into these three types of DC phases are proposed.

27007236|t|A Financial Market Model Incorporating Herd Behaviour.
27007236|a|UNASSIGNED: Herd behaviour in financial markets is a recurring phenomenon that exacerbates asset price volatility, and is considered a possible contributor to market fragility. While numerous studies investigate herd behaviour in financial markets, it is often considered without reference to the pricing of financial instruments or other market dynamics. Here, a trader interaction model based upon informational cascades in the presence of information thresholds is used to construct a new model of asset price returns that allows for both quiescent and herd-like regimes. Agent interaction is modelled using a stochastic pulse-coupled network, parametrised by information thresholds and a network coupling probability. Agents may possess either one or two information thresholds that, in each case, determine the number of distinct states an agent may occupy before trading takes place. In the case where agents possess two thresholds (labelled as the finite state-space model, corresponding to agents' accumulating information over a bounded state-space), and where coupling strength is maximal, an asymptotic expression for the cascade-size probability is derived and shown to follow a power law when a critical value of network coupling probability is attained. For a range of model parameters, a mixture of negative binomial distributions is used to approximate the cascade-size distribution. This approximation is subsequently used to express the volatility of model price returns in terms of the model parameter which controls the network coupling probability. In the case where agents possess a single pulse-coupling threshold (labelled as the semi-infinite state-space model corresponding to agents' accumulating information over an unbounded state-space), numerical evidence is presented that demonstrates volatility clustering and long-memory patterns in the volatility of asset returns. Finally, output from the model is compared to both the distribution of historical stock returns and the market price of an equity index option.

27000132|t|Application of a Dual-Arm Robot in Complex Sample Preparation and Measurement Processes.
27000132|a|UNASSIGNED: Automation systems with applied robotics have already been established in industrial applications for many years. In the field of life sciences, a comparable high level of automation can be found in the areas of bioscreening and high-throughput screening. Strong deficits still exist in the development of flexible and universal fully automated systems in the field of analytical measurement. Reasons are the heterogeneous processes with complex structures, which include sample preparation and transport, analytical measurements using complex sensor systems, and suitable data analysis and evaluation. Furthermore, the use of nonstandard sample vessels with various shapes and volumes results in an increased complexity. The direct use of existing automation solutions from bioscreening applications is not possible. A flexible automation system for sample preparation, analysis, and data evaluation is presented in this article. It is applied for the determination of cholesterol in biliary endoprosthesis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A dual-arm robot performs both transport and active manipulation tasks to ensure human-like operation. This general robotic concept also enables the use of manual laboratory devices and equipment and is thus suitable in areas with a high standardization grade.

27003836|t|Biomechanical characteristics of pedicle screws in osteoporotic vertebrae - comparing a new cadaver corpectomy model and pure pull-out testing.
27003836|a|UNASSIGNED: Currently, evaluation of the stability of spinal instrumentations often focuses on simple pull-out or cyclic loading. However, the loading characteristics and the specimen alignment rarely simulate physiological loading conditions, or the clinical situation itself. The purpose of this study was to develop an alternative setup and parameters to compare static and dynamic characteristics of pedicle screws at the bone-implant interface in lumbar osteoporotic cadavers. A corpectomy model development was based on ASTM-1717 standard, allowing a deflection of the cranial and caudal element under loading. Twelve human osteoporotic vertebrae (L1-L4) were analyzed for morphological CT-data and T-Score. For group A (n   =   6) loads were simulated as in vivo measurements during walking, representing two months postoperatively. A subsequent pull-out was performed. Group B (n   =   6) was tested with pure pull-out. Screw loosening at the tip/head was optically measured and analyzed with respect to clinical patterns. Correlations between CT-data, T-Score and in vitro parameters were determined. For group A, the subsidence for the head/tip was measured towards the upper/lower endplate, resulting in visible deflections. The progress of the subsidence was greatest within the first and last cycles until failure. The predominant patterns were pure rotation and toggling. However, the pull-out between groups was not significantly different. Pedicle-angle and cyclic-subsidence correlated with R   =   0.806/0.794. T-Score and pull-out correlated only in group A. With the corpectomy setup, clinically observed wipe effects and a loss of correction could be simulated. The presented parameters facilitate analysis of the complex changing load distributions and interactions between the left and right bone-implant interface. This article is protected by copyright.

27004938|t|Association Between Thrombophilic Gene Mutations and the Risk of Vascular Access Thrombosis in Hemodialysis Patients.
27004938|a|UNASSIGNED: The cause of thrombosis in hemodialysis vascular access is considered to be of a multifactorial nature, including stenosis of the venous or arterial connection. Therefore, identification of relevant thrombotic risk factors could lead to an improved antithrombotic therapy. This case control study was performed to evaluate the relationship between Factor V (G1691A and A4070G) and Factor II polymorphisms and vascular access thrombosis in hemodialysis patients. One hundred and twenty-one patients undergoing dialysis were selected as subjects. This sample was divided into two groups; a case group of 60 patients who had sustained one or more thrombotic events that resulted in vascular access failure and a control group of 61 patients, who never had a thrombotic occlusion of a functioning permanent dialysis access. Our data demonstrated a significantly increased risk of vascular access thrombosis in carriers of the mutant FV (G1691A and A4070G) polymorphisms (P < 0.05).Further studies on a large-scale population and other genetic variants will be needed to find candidate genes for vascular access thrombosis in hemodialysis patients.

27004166|t|Injuries in jumpers - are there any patterns?
27004166|a|Suicide as a cause of death, affects every health system, and is a particular problem in heavily urbanised states and low and middle income countries (which account for 75% of suicide deaths). The World Health Organisation records that 800000 commit suicide each year, representing 1.4% of annual global deaths, and that suicide was the second leading cause of death in 15-29 year-olds across the world in 2012. In the United Kingdom, jumping from height accounts for 3%-5% of the 140000 suicide attempts annually is similar incidence to the rest of Europe. The Medline and EMBASE were interrogated for studies examining suicide caused by jumping from height. Manual screening of titles and abstracts was used to identify relevant works before data was extracted and systematically reviewed to identify the characteristics of a patient who jumps from height to commit suicide, delineate their patterns of injury and explore techniques that could be used to limit its occurrence. Emergency departments receiving patients who jump from a height need to have an understanding of the potential pathology that is likely to be encountered in order to deliver multidisciplinary, efficient and timely care in order that the impact of this devastating physical, psychological and social problem could modified to the benefit of the patients involved.

27006345|t|Protocol for the development and validation of a questionnaire to assess concerning behaviours and mental health in individuals with autism spectrum disorders: the Assessment of Concerning Behaviour (ACB) scale.
27006345|a|INTRODUCTION: Co-occurring psychiatric conditions and concerning behaviours are prevalent in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and are likely to be detrimental to functioning and long-term outcomes. The cognitive rigidity and deficits in emotional literacy and verbal behaviour that commonly occur in ASD can adversely affect clinicians' confidence to identify concerning behaviours and mental health problems. There is a need to develop a measure that is tailored towards individuals with ASD, and differentiates between symptoms of psychopathology and core ASD symptoms. Furthermore, it should be modified to capture internalising symptoms that individuals with ASD may find difficult or be unable to verbalise. This protocol describes the intended development and validation of the Assessment of Concerning Behaviour (ACB) scale. The ACB will aim to be a multidimensional measure of concerning behaviours in ASD incorporating self-report, parent/carer, teacher/employer and clinician report versions that can be used across the lifespan and spectrum of intellectual ability. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will be guided by the methods described in the US Food and Drug Administration Guidance for Industry Patient-reported Outcome Measures. A literature review, cognitive interviews and focus groups with individuals who have experience of working or living with ASDs will be used for item generation. A sample of children and adults with ASD will complete the ACB, in addition to other gold standard measures of concerning behaviour in order to establish the initial psychometric properties of the scale. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has received ethical approval from the NHS Research Ethics Committee: London-Camden and King's Cross (ref: 15/LO/0085). Study findings will be disseminated to healthcare professionals and scientists in the field through publication in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations.

27056567|t|Pak1, adjuvant tamoxifen therapy, and breast cancer recurrence risk in a Danish population-based study.
27056567|a|UNASSIGNED: Background Adjuvant tamoxifen therapy approximately halves the risk of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer recurrence, but many women do not respond to therapy. Observational studies nested in clinical trial populations suggest that overexpression or nuclear localization of p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) in primary tumors predicts tamoxifen failure. Material and methods We measured the association between Pak1 expression and breast cancer recurrence in a Danish population-based case-control study. Pak1 cytoplasmic expression level and nuclear positivity were determined by immunohistochemical staining of primary breast tumors from recurrence cases and matched controls from two breast cancer populations; women diagnosed with ER-positive tumors who received at least one year of tamoxifen therapy (ER+/TAM+), and women diagnosed with ER-negative tumors who survived for at least one year (ER-/TAM-). Pak1 staining was assessed by a single, blinded pathologist, and associations were estimated with conditional logistic regression models. Results We included 541 recurrence cases and 1:1 matched controls from the ER+/TAM   +   group and 300 recurrence cases and 1:1 matched controls from the ER-/TAM   -   group. Pak1 cytoplasmic intensity was not associated with breast cancer recurrence in either group (ER+/TAM   +   ORadj for strong vs. no cytoplasmic staining   =   0.91, 95% CI 0.57, 1.5; ER-/TAM   -   ORadj for strong vs. no cytoplasmic staining   =   0.74, 95% CI 0.39, 1.4). Associations between Pak1 nuclear positivity and breast cancer recurrence were similarly near null in both groups. Conclusion Pak1 positivity in primary breast tumors was neither predictive nor prognostic in this prospective, population-based study.

27035250|t|Ultrasound in the Assessment of Myopathic Disorders.
27035250|a|UNASSIGNED: Neuromuscular ultrasound (US) augments a careful physical examination and electrodiagnostic evaluation in the evaluation of suspected myopathy. Ultrasound evaluation of muscle can identify abnormal echo intensity, size, and movement. Because it is painless and noninvasive, US can be used to evaluate multiple muscles to direct the electrodiagnostic examination or muscle biopsy. Some patterns of muscle involvement can suggest specific etiologies. Most muscular dystrophies show homogenously increased muscle echo intensity with attenuation of the US signal, likely resultant from increased intramuscular fat and fibrosis. Inflammatory myopathies can also show homogenously increased echogenicity but lack the signal attenuation seen in muscular dystrophies. In contrast, denervation can show "moth-eaten," atrophic muscles with fasciculations. Advanced age and obesity also impacts muscle size and echo intensity and can hamper efforts to detect mild pathologies. The sensitivity and specificity of US for detecting neuromuscular disease have been best studied in children and depend on the type and severity of the disorder. In general, muscle US yields sensitivities and specificities of 67% to 100% for detecting neuromuscular disorders in children and is similar to electromyogram for detection of myopathy. Ultrasound is most sensitive for detecting muscular dystrophies and is less sensitive in metabolic myopathies and very young children.

27013113|t|Telocytes in their context with other intercellular communication agents.
27013113|a|UNASSIGNED: The past decade has borne witness to an explosion in our understanding of the fundamental complexities of intercellular communication. Previously, the field was solely defined by the simple exchange of endocrine, autocrine and epicrine agents. Then it was discovered that cells possess an elaborate system of extracellular vesicles, including exosomes, which carry a vast array of small and large molecules (including many epigenetic agents such as a variety RNAs and DNA), as well as large organelles that modulate almost every aspect of cellular function. In addition, it was thought that electrical communication between cells was limited mainly to neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in the nervous system. Also within the past decade, it was found that - in addition to neurons - most cells (both mammalian and non-mammalian) communicate via elaborate bioelectric systems which modulate many fundamental cellular processes including growth, differentiation, morphogenesis and repair. In the nervous system, volume transmission via the extracellular matrix has been added to the list. Lastly, it was discovered that what had previously been regarded as simple connective cells in most tissues proved to be miniature communication devices now known as telocytes. These unusually long, tenuous and sinuous cells utilize elaborate electrical, chemical and epigenetic mechanisms, including the exchange of exosomes, to integrate many activities within and between nearly all types of cells in tissues and organs. Their interrelationship with neural stem cells and neurogenesis in the context of neurodegenerative disease is just beginning to be explored. This review presents an account of precisely how each of these varied mechanisms are relevant and critical to the understanding of what telocytes are and how they function.

27073031|t|Molecular Modeling and Physicochemical Properties of Supramolecular Complexes of Limonene with a- and b-Cyclodextrins.
27073031|a|UNASSIGNED: This study evaluated three different methods for the formation of an inclusion complex between alpha- and beta-cyclodextrin (a- and b-CD) and limonene (LIM) with the goal of improving the physicochemical properties of limonene. The study samples were prepared through physical mixing (PM), paste complexation (PC), and slurry complexation (SC) methods in the molar ratio of 1:1 (cyclodextrin:limonene). The complexes prepared were evaluated with thermogravimetry/derivate thermogravimetry, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, complexation efficiency through gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analyses, molecular modeling, and nuclear magnetic resonance. The results showed that the physical mixing procedure did not produce complexation, but the paste and slurry methods produced inclusion complexes, which demonstrated interactions outside of the cavity of the CDs. However, the paste obtained with b-cyclodextrin did not demonstrate complexation in the gas chromatographic technique because, after extraction, most of the limonene was either surface-adsorbed by b-cyclodextrin or volatilized during the procedure. We conclude that paste complexation and slurry complexation are effective and economic methods to improve the physicochemical character of limonene and could have important applications in pharmacological activities in terms of an increase in solubility.

27132813|t|Oxalicumone A, a new dihydrothiophene-condensed sulfur chromone induces apoptosis in leukemia cells through endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway.
27132813|a|UNASSIGNED: Oxalicumone A (POA1), a novel dihydrothiophene-condensed sulfur chromone isolated from the marine fungus Penicillium oxalicum SCSGAF 0023, showed cytotoxicity against several cancer cells previously. In this study, its anti-cancer activity and underlying mechanism of this action were investigated in leukemia cells like KG-1a, HL60, U937, and K562. The results showed that POA1 inhibited dose-/time-dependently cell growth and induced apoptosis in leukemia cells. Also, POA1 caused cleavages of caspase-3, 8, 9 and PARP1, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, up-regulations of phosphorylated p38 and JNK, and activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress). Furthermore, 4-PBA (an ER stress inhibitor) but not SP600125 and SB203580 (JNK and p38 inhibitor, respectively) could largely inhibit POA1-induced growth suppression. Additionally, 4-PBA obstructed mitochondrial depolarization and cleavage of PARP1. These data suggested that ER stress pathway might be an important mediator in POA1-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, POA1 may have antitumor effects in leukemia cells through the induction of ER stress pathway.

27136722|t|Process development and intensification for enhanced production of Bacillus lipopeptides.
27136722|a|UNASSIGNED: The growing interest in Bacillus lipopeptides for high-value applications has driven process design, development and optimization for enhanced lipopeptide production. Traditional optimization approaches have been directed towards improving the overall titres by modification of media components and environmental parameters, almost exclusively in submerged cultures. Carbon and nitrogen sources, trace elements and oxygen availability have all been demonstrated to exhibit significant influences on lipopeptide yield, productivity and selectivity. This insight into process-linked kinetics, especially selectivity, has led to the introduction of novel process intensification and integration strategies which further promote process efficiency, and which include foam fractionation, inverse fluidization, rotating disc contacting and microfiltration with recycle. These strategies have not only transformed the production capabilities, but have also successfully integrated upstream production with downstream purification through cell retention and in situ product removal. This review analyses and critically discusses the impact of process conditions and process optimization strategies for improving lipopeptide production kinetics, specifically highlighting the emerging trend of process intensification and integration strategies and further, proposes a heuristic route to enhance lipopeptide production.

27138112|t|COMT Val(158) Met genotype is associated with reward learning: A replication study and meta-analysis.
27138112|a|UNASSIGNED: Identifying mechanisms through which individual differences in reward learning emerge offers an opportunity to understand both a fundamental form of adaptive responding as well as etiological pathways through which aberrant reward learning may contribute to maladaptive behaviors and psychopathology. One candidate mechanism through which individual differences in reward learning may emerge is variability in dopaminergic reinforcement signaling. A common functional polymorphism within the catechol-O-methyl transferase gene (COMT; rs4680, Val158Met) has been linked to reward learning where homozygosity for the Met allele (linked to heightened prefrontal dopamine function and decreased dopamine synthesis in the midbrain) has been associated with relatively increased reward learning. Here, we used a probabilistic reward learning task to asses response bias, a behavioral form of reward learning, across 3 separate samples that were combined for analyses (age: 21.80        3.95; n   =   392; 268 female; European-American: n   =   208). We replicate prior reports that COMT rs4680 Met allele homozygosity is associated with increased reward learning in European-American participants (b   =   0.20, t   =   2.75, p   <   0.01;    R(2) =0.04). Moreover, a meta-analysis of 4 studies, including the current one, confirmed the association between COMT rs4680 genotype and reward learning (95% CI -0.11 to -0.03; z   =   3.2; p   <   0.01). These results suggest that variability in dopamine signaling associated with COMT rs4680 influences individual differences in reward which may potentially contribute to psychopathology characterized by reward dysfunction.

27140631|t|Modeling when, where, and how to manage a forest epidemic, motivated by sudden oak death in California.
27140631|a|UNASSIGNED: Sudden oak death, caused by Phytophthora ramorum, has killed millions of oak and tanoak in California since its first detection in 1995. Despite some localized small-scale management, there has been no large-scale attempt to slow the spread of the pathogen in California. Here we use a stochastic spatially explicit model parameterized using data on the spread of P. ramorum to investigate whether and how the epidemic can be controlled. We find that slowing the spread of P. ramorum is now not possible, and has been impossible for a number of years. However, despite extensive cryptic (i.e., presymptomatic) infection and frequent long-range transmission, effective exclusion of the pathogen from large parts of the state could, in principle, have been possible were it to have been started by 2002. This is the approximate date by which sufficient knowledge of P. ramorum epidemiology had accumulated for large-scale management to be realistic. The necessary expenditure would have been very large, but could have been greatly reduced by optimizing the radius within which infected sites are treated and careful selection of sites to treat. In particular, we find that a dynamic strategy treating sites on the epidemic wave front leads to optimal performance. We also find that "front loading" the budget, that is, treating very heavily at the start of the management program, would greatly improve control. Our work introduces a framework for quantifying the likelihood of success and risks of failure of management that can be applied to invading pests and pathogens threatening forests worldwide.

27113065|t|[A study using positron emission tomography of a case of vascular dementia due to left thalamic haematoma, an example of the diaschisis phenomenon].
27113065|a|INTRODUCTION: Thalamic vascular lesions as strategic strokes can cause amnesia, executive dysfunctions or dysphasia and behavioral or psychological symptoms causing vascular dementia. CASE REPORT: A 58 years-old woman with hypertension and dyslipemia, who after a left thalamic hemorrhage with good radiological evolution, presents a severe amnesic syndrome as well as other subtle changes in orientation and in language, difficulties in managing money and depressive symptoms requiring anxiolytic and antidepressive treatment. All this joined to limitations in the normal course of her work. Followed by neurology service, a positron emission tomography with 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose integrated with computed tomography was performed, which showed a hypometabolism in left thalamic area and also in ipsilateral inferior frontal region, explained by the diaschisis phenomenon. CONCLUSIONS: Diaschisis phenomenon is a neuroimaging and pathophysiological finding whereby thalamic or basal ganglia strokes cause hypoperfusion/hypometabolism in the ipsilateral or contralateral cortex and could explain cortical distal symptoms. This case report demonstrates the presence of thalamocortical connections, which helps to understand the circuitry of memory and help to explain the association of other cortical symptoms as dysphasia or executive dysfunction.

27117614|a|Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva(FOP)is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive heterotopic ossification(HO)in skeletal muscle, tendons and ligaments. FOP is caused by gain-of-function mutations of ALK2, a receptor of bone morphogenetic proteins. Immune responses have been suggested to be involved in HO in FOP, because muscle trauma induces acute HO in patients with FOP. Recently, Activin A, a non-osteogenic ligand, was identified as a ligand of the mutated ALK2 to induce HO. It was suggested that Activin A is a novel interface between FOP and osteoimmunology.

27114085|t|The effect of palmitate supplementation on gene expression profile in proliferating myoblasts.
27114085|a|UNASSIGNED: High-fat diet, exposure to saturated fatty acids, or the presence of adipocytes in myoblast microenvironment affects skeletal muscle growth and function. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of palmitate supplementation on transcriptomic profile of mouse C2C12 myoblasts. Global gene expression was evaluated using whole mouse genome oligonucleotide microarrays, and the results were validated through qPCR. A total of 4047 genes were identified as differentially expressed, including 3492 downregulated and 555 upregulated genes, during a 48-h exposure to palmitate (0.1  mmol/l). Functional classification showed the involvement of these genes in several processes which regulate cell growth. In conclusion, the addition of palmitate modifies the expression of genes associated with (1) myoblast responsiveness to hormones and growth factors, (2) cytokine and growth factor expression, and (3) regulation of cell-cell and cell-matrix communication. Such alterations can affect myoblast growth and differentiation; however, further studies in this field are required.

27098324|t|Use of the Reamer/Irrigator/Aspirator Decreases Carotid and Cranial Embolic Events in a Canine Model.
27098324|a|BACKGROUND: Approximately 2 million patients in the United States annually undergo total joint arthroplasty with reaming and placement of intramedullary nails, resulting in extravasation of bone marrow and fat into the circulatory system and potentially causing fat embolism syndrome. Acute and chronic changes in mental status documented after these procedures may be related to embolic events. The Reamer/Irrigator/Aspirator (RIA) device has been shown to decrease intramedullary pressure during reaming. We hypothesized that the use of the RIA in a canine model would reduce the number of microemboli detected in the carotid artery and brain compared with nailing either with or without reaming. METHODS: Twenty-four large canines underwent unreamed nailing (UR), sequentially reamed nailing (SR), or RIA-reamed nailing (RIA) of bilateral femora (eight dogs per group). During reaming and nailing, the number and size of microemboli transiting the carotid artery were recorded. After euthanasia, the brain was harvested for immunostaining and measurement of microinfarction volumes. RESULTS: Total embolic load passing through the carotid artery was 0.049 cc (UR), 0.045 cc (SR), and 0.013 cc (RIA). The number and size of microemboli in the UR and SR groups were similar; however, the RIA group had significantly fewer larger-sized (>200- m) emboli (p = 0.03). Pathologic examination of the brain confirmed particulate emboli, and histologic analyses demonstrated upregulation of stress-related proteins in all groups, with fewer emboli and less evidence of stress for RIA reaming. CONCLUSIONS: RIA reaming decreased microemboli compared with traditional reaming and unreamed nailing, suggesting that intramedullary pressure and heat are important variables. The documented embolic events and brain stress may help to explain subtle neurobehavioral symptoms commonly seen in patients after undergoing long-bone reaming procedures. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: RIA reaming decreased cranial embolic events and may have an ameliorating effect on postoperative neurologic sequelae.

27097691|t|Three-Way Laryngeal Mask Reduces Anesthesia-Related Stress Responses in Bronchoalveolar Lavage: An Experimental Canine Study.
27097691|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the ventilatory effects of the three-way laryngeal mask airway (TLMA) and tracheal tube (TT) on hemodynamics, respiratory function, and stress responses in a canine model during bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). STUDY DESIGN: Experimental study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: The 303rd Hospital of the Chinese People_#039;s Liberation Army in May 2013. METHODOLOGY: Sixteen dogs were divided into two groups. MAP, SpO2 and HR were recorded before anesthesia (T0), immediately before intubation (T1), during intubation (T2), at 3 (T3) and 10 (T4) minutes after mechanical ventilation, at 10 (T5), 20 (T6), and 30 (T7) minutes during the course of BAL, during extubation (T8), and 3 minutes after extubation (T9). Tidal volume, peak inspiratory airway pressure, and expiratory CO2 pressure were recorded at time points T2, T5, T6, T7, and T8. Stress responses variables, including epinephrine and norepinephrine levels, were examined at time points T0, T2, T3, T5, T8, and T9. RESULTS: BAL was successfully completed in all animals. In comparison to the TT, the TLMA was capable of maintaining hemodynamic stability and ventilation (p _ 0.05), and producing less stress responses (p _ 0.05). CONCLUSION: In a canine model, ventilation with the TLMA was better than the TT during BAL in terms of maintaining effective ventilation and stable hemodynamics, and producing less stress responses.

27096803|t|Phylogenetic characterization of Canine Parvovirus VP2 partial sequences from symptomatic dogs samples.
27096803|a|The aim of the present study was to detect canine parvovirus (CPV) from faecal samples of clinically ill domestic dogs by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by VP2 gene partial sequencing and molecular characterization of circulating strains in Lithuania. Eleven clinically and antigen-tested positive dog faecal samples, collected during the period of 2014-2015, were investigated by using PCR. The phylogenetic investigations indicated that the Lithuanian CPV VP2 partial sequences (3025-3706 cds) were closely related and showed 99.0-99.9% identity. All Lithuanian sequences were associated with one phylogroup, but grouped in different clusters. Ten of investigated Lithuanian CPV VP2 sequences were closely associated with CPV 2a antigenic variant (99.4% nt identity). Five CPV VP2 sequences from Lithuania were related to CPV-2a, but were rather divergent (6.8 nt differences). Only one CPV VP2 sequence from Lithuania was associated (99.3% nt identity) with CPV-2b VP2 sequences from France, Italy, USA and Korea. The four of eleven investigated Lithuanian dogs with CPV infection symptoms were vaccinated with CPV-2 vaccine, but their VP2 sequences were phylogenetically distantly associated with CPV vaccine strains VP2 sequences (11.5-15.8 nt differences). Ten Lithuanian CPV VP2 sequences had monophyletic relations among the close geographically associated samples, but five of them were rather divergent (1.0% less sequence similarity). The one Lithuanian CPV VP2 sequence was closely related with CPV-2b antigenic variant. All the Lithuanian CPV VP2 partial sequences were conservative and phylogenetically low associated with most commonly used CPV vaccine strains.

27015016|t|Patient education and its effect on self-management in cirrhosis: a pilot study.
27015016|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients with cirrhosis can contribute significantly to maintaining compensation through simple lifestyle measures. It is, however, unknown whether they possess sufficient knowledge to make informed decisions with regard to their health, with few resources invested in patient education. We aimed to determine the level of knowledge that patients with cirrhosis possess and whether an information leaflet can make a positive impact on this. METHODS: We prospectively recruited clinically stable patients with cirrhosis to take part in a preintervention/postintervention study. Thirty-nine patients were recruited either to take part in a telephone-based questionnaire followed by repeating the questionnaire 2 months after receipt of a leaflet or to receive the leaflet directly and complete the questionnaire 2 months later. RESULTS: The questionnaire demonstrated that baseline knowledge in the study group was poor, with a mean score of 3.4 out of a possible 9 points. There was a statistically significant improvement in the score to 7.5 in those who used the leaflet (Wilcoxon's signed-ranked test, P=0.0006). The mean score achieved by those who received the leaflet directly was 6.8, which is comparable to the scores of patients in the first cohort who read the leaflet and is significantly higher than the scores of the same participants before reading the leaflet (Wilcoxon's rank-sum test, P=0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that patients with cirrhosis lack the knowledge to effectively manage their disease. The introduction of a leaflet resulted in a statistically significant improvement in understanding. Longitudinal studies are required to assess whether such interventions can result in improved clinical outcomes.

27013830|t|Tuberculosis presenting as posttraumatic panophthalmitis.
27013830|a|Panophthalmitis is one of rare manifestations of tuberculosis described in atypical situations such as children, immune compromised patients, or drug abuse. The present report describes the first case of tubercular panophthalmitis developing after trauma in an otherwise healthy adult patient. A 46-year-old female patient presented with corneal infiltrate and endophthalmitis that developed after an injury to right eye with wooden object. Corneal scrapings and vitreous tap were sterile. The patient did not improve with antibiotics and developed panophthalmitis. On evisceration of the painful blind eye, histopathology showed the presence of granulomatous inflammation and acid-fast bacilli. The patient had no other systemic focus of tubercular infection. The patient was managed with anti-tubercular therapy for 6 months. Atypical presentations of tuberculosis like panophthalmitis pose a difficult problem in diagnosis as well as treatment. Direct inoculation of bacilli during trauma is a rare source of infection. This case report presents unusual development of tubercular panophthalmitis following direct inoculation of bacilli during trauma. Ocular tuberculosis should be considered in differential diagnosis of posttraumatic endophthalmitis and panophthalmitis, especially in endemic regions like India.

27096800|t|Clinical, endoscopic and histopathological evaluation of the efficacy of budesonide in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in dogs.
27096800|a|This study evaluates the efficacy of budesonide in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in dogs based on the results of clinical, endoscopic and histopathological examinations. The severity of clinical symptoms was assessed based on CIBDAI scores, and macroscopic and histopathological changes were described in accordance with the recommendations of the WSAVA Gastrointestinal Standardization Group for 2008. The results of the experiment revealed that budesonide does not offer effective treatment for canine IBD. The tested drug failed to alleviate the clinical symptoms of disease, lower CIBDAI scores, or improve the macroscopic appearance of intestinal mucosa. The effectiveness of budesonide was most highly evaluated in the histopathological picture of duodenal, jejunal and colonic mucosa.

27096797|t|Detection of Helicobacter spp. in the saliva of dogs with gastritis.
27096797|a|The aim of this study was to identify the species and determine the prevalence of gastric Helicobacter in the saliva of dogs with gastritis. The study was carried out on 30 dogs of different breeds, genders and ages, which were diagnosed with gastritis. The nested-PCR method was used to detect Helicobacter spp. in saliva. Helicobacter bacteria were found in the saliva samples of 23 (76.6%) dogs. Helicobacter heilmannii was the most commonly detected species of gastric Helicobacter spp. in canine saliva, and was found in 22 (73.3%) cases. The results indicate that gastric Helicobacter spp. occurs relatively frequently in dogs with gastritis. Moreover, the saliva of dogs with gastritis may be a source of Helicobacter spp. infection for humans and other animals. However, further studies are needed to confirm this finding as the PCR method does not distinguish active from inactive infections.

27096781|t|Rush sublingual immunotherapy in canine atopic dermatitis: a prospective pilot study.
27096781|a|Twenty dogs with canine atopic dermatitis (CAD) were treated with rush sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT), with a 48 hour build-up phase and 6 months maintenance phase (treated by antigen once every 3-4 weeks). The canine atopic dermatitis extent and severity index (CADESI)-4 was evaluated before treatment (baseline) and after 6 months. An open, non-controlled, non-randomized pilot trial was conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of rush SLIT for environmental allergen extracts (Dematophagoides pteronyssinus and D.farinae mix and other). Three dogs dropped out and 17 dogs finished the trial. CADESI-4 at baseline was 60.6  27.1 (range 17-107, n=17). After 6 months of SLIT treatment, CADESI-4 was 37.4  36.0 (range 5-152, n=17) (p<0.01), which was a 38.3% reduction. A significant improvement, defined as a CADESI-4 reduction of >30%, was observed in 13 out of 17 dogs (76%). A moderate improvement, defined as a CADESI-4 reduction of    30%, was observed in 2 dogs (12%). In the other 2 dogs (12%), CADESI-4 worsened or showed no change. However, no severe adverse effects were observed during the trial. Therefore, rush SLIT against environmental allergen extract for CAD showed effectiveness and safety as evidenced by the reduction of CADESI-4 after 6 months SLIT without severe adverse effects.

There are reports indicating that dogs are the most common species affected by myiasis. This study was conducted to identify myiasis-causing flies in owned and stray dogs in Mashhad (Northeastern Iran). METHODS: A total of 435 owned dogs and 800 stray dogs were examined for myiasis. Myiasis cases were cured and fly larvae were identified by microscopy using the relevant standard identification keys. RESULTS: Ten out of 435 owned dogs (2.29 %) and 18 out of 800 stray dogs (2.25 %) had myiasis. The causative agents of myiasis in dogs based on their frequencies were as follows: Wohlfahrtia magnifica (50%), Lucilia sericata (28.57%) and Chrysomya albiceps (21.42%). CONCLUSION: W. magnifica was the most important myiasis-causing fly among the dogs sampled here, sometimes causing very serious damages. However, when treatment was given early enough, the larvae removed and the wound disinfected, the animals usually made a full recovery.

27094260|t|Insights on adaptive and innate immunity in canine leishmaniosis.
27094260|a|UNASSIGNED: Canine leishmaniosis (CanL) is caused by the parasite Leishmania infantum and is a systemic disease, which can present with variable clinical signs, and clinicopathological abnormalities. Clinical manifestations can range from subclinical infection to very severe systemic disease. Leishmaniosis is categorized as a neglected tropical disease and the complex immune responses associated with Leishmania species makes therapeutic treatments and vaccine development challenging for both dogs and humans. In this review, we summarize innate and adaptive immune responses associated with L. infantum infection in dogs, and we discuss the problems associated with the disease as well as potential solutions and the future direction of required research to help control the parasite.
